LangGraph is a low-level orchestration framework for building controllable agents. While [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/introduction/) provides integrations and composable components to streamline LLM application development, the LangGraph library enables agent orchestration — offering customizable architectures, long-term memory, and human-in-the-loop to reliably handle complex tasks.

## Get started

First, install LangGraph:

```
pip install -U langgraph
```

There are two ways to get started with LangGraph:

- [Use prebuilt components](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/agents/agents/): Construct agentic systems quickly and reliably without the need to implement orchestration, memory, or human feedback handling from scratch.
- [Use LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/introduction/): Customize your architectures, use long-term memory, and implement human-in-the-loop to reliably handle complex tasks.

Once you have a LangGraph application and are ready to move into production, use [LangGraph Platform](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/cloud/quick_start/) to test, debug, and deploy your application.

## What LangGraph provides

LangGraph provides low-level supporting infrastructure that sits underneath *any* workflow or agent. It does not abstract prompts or architecture, and provides three central benefits:

### Persistence

LangGraph has a [persistence layer](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/persistence/), which offers a number of benefits:

- [Memory](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/memory/): LangGraph persists arbitrary aspects of your application's state, supporting memory of conversations and other updates within and across user interactions;
- [Human-in-the-loop](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/human_in_the_loop/): Because state is checkpointed, execution can be interrupted and resumed, allowing for decisions, validation, and corrections via human input.

### Streaming

LangGraph provides support for [streaming](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/streaming/) workflow / agent state to the user (or developer) over the course of execution. LangGraph supports streaming of both events ([such as feedback from a tool call](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/streaming.ipynb#updates)) and [tokens from LLM calls](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/streaming-tokens.ipynb) embedded in an application.

### Debugging and deployment

LangGraph provides an easy onramp for testing, debugging, and deploying applications via [LangGraph Platform](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/langgraph_platform/). This includes [Studio](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/langgraph_studio/), an IDE that enables visualization, interaction, and debugging of workflows or agents. This also includes numerous [options](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/deployment/) for deployment. 

## LangGraph’s ecosystem

While LangGraph can be used standalone, it also integrates seamlessly with any LangChain product, giving developers a full suite of tools for building agents. To improve your LLM application development, pair LangGraph with:

- [LangSmith](http://www.langchain.com/langsmith) — Helpful for agent evals and observability. Debug poor-performing LLM app runs, evaluate agent trajectories, gain visibility in production, and improve performance over time.
- [LangGraph Platform](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/#langgraph-platform) — Deploy and scale agents effortlessly with a purpose-built deployment platform for long running, stateful workflows. Discover, reuse, configure, and share agents across teams — and iterate quickly with visual prototyping in [LangGraph Studio](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/langgraph_studio/).
