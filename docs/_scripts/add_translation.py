TRANSLATION_PROMPT = (
    "You are a helpful assistant that translates Python-based technical "
    "documentation written in Markdown to equivalent TypeScript-based documentation. "
    "The input is a Markdown file written in mkdocs format. It contains "
    "Python code snippets embedded in prose. "
    "Your task is to rewrite the content by translating the Python code to "
    "idiomatic TypeScript, using the provided TypeScript reference snippets "
    "to ensure accurate and consistent usage (e.g., correct imports, function "
    "names, and patterns). "
    "Remove the original Python code and replace it with the corresponding "
    "TypeScript version. "
    "Do not alter the surrounding prose unless a change is necessary to "
    "reflect differences between Python and TypeScript. "
    "Preserve the structure and formatting of the original Markdown document. "

    "the translation. "
    "Use the reference TypeScript snippets as guidance whenever possible to "
    "maintain alignment with existing conventions.\n\n"
    "IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS:\n"
    "- Use Zod for state definition for StateGraph. Avoid using Annotation since it will be deprecated in the future.\n"
    "- ALWAYS use fluent interface (method chaining) for StateGraph operations - this is CRITICAL\n"

CONSOLIDATION_PROMPT = (

    "written in Markdown into a single unified Markdown document. "
    "The input consists of two documents: the first is for Python users, and the second is for JavaScript/TypeScript users. "
    "Your task is to merge these into one Markdown file using language-specific fenced blocks to separate the content where needed. "
    "Use the following syntax to distinguish content for each language:\n\n"
    ":::python\n"
    "# Python-specific content\n"
    ":::\n\n"
    ":::js\n"
    "# JavaScript/TypeScript-specific content\n"
    ":::\n\n"
    "Follow these consolidation rules:\n"
    "- When content (prose or code) is the same or nearly identical in both versions, include it only onceâ€”outside of any fenced block.\n"
    "- When content differs between the Python and JS versions, wrap each version in its corresponding fenced block.\n"
    "- Prefer **paragraph-level separation** of language-specific content. Do not combine Python and JS snippets or terminology in the same sentence or paragraph using conditional phrases.\n"
    "  For example, avoid inline constructs like:\n"
    "  `The :::python add_messages ::: :::js reducer ::: function...`\n"
    "  Instead, write two distinct paragraphs:\n\n"
    "  :::python\n"
    "  The `add_messages` function in our `State` will append the LLM's response messages to whatever messages are already in the state.\n"
    "  ::: \n\n"
    "  :::js\n"
    "  The `reducer` function in our `StateAnnotation` will append the LLM's response messages to whatever messages are already in the state.\n"
    "  :::\n\n"
    "- Preserve the overall structure, ordering, and formatting of the original Markdown documents.\n"
    "- Do not rephrase or unify content unless it is logically and semantically identical.\n"
    "- Use the fenced blocks for both prose and code as needed, and ensure output is clean, readable Markdown suitable for tools that parse these directives.\n"
    "Your goal is to produce a cleanly merged documentation file that serves both Python and JavaScript users without redundancy, while maximizing clarity and separation of language-specific details."
