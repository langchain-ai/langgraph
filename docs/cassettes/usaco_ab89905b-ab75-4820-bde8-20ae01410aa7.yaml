      problem involves simulating movement through a network of ports based on a repeating
      sequence of left/right directions. The key aspects are:\n1. The network of ports
      is represented as a graph, where each port has a \"left\" and \"right\" outgoing
      edge to other ports. \n2. A sequence of M left/right directions is given, which
      is repeated K times.\n3. We need to determine the final port after following
      this repeated sequence starting from port 1.\n\nTo solve this, we can:\n1. Read
      in the port graph and store the left/right destinations for each port\n2. Simulate
      the movement:\n   - Maintain a current port\n   - For each direction in the
      sequence:\n     - If ''L'', move to the left port, else move to the right port\n   -
      Repeat the sequence K times in total\n3. Output the final port\n\nThe number
      of repetitions K can be very large (up to 1 billion), so we need to find a way
      to avoid simulating all K repetitions. \n\nOne optimization is to notice that
      if we ever visit the same port twice at the same point in the direction sequence,
      we have entered a cycle. We can fast-forward by calculating how many full cycles
      are left.\n\nSo an optimized approach would be:\n1. Simulate the first M * N
      steps, keeping track of the port and position in the sequence for each step\n2.
      If a cycle is detected (same port and sequence position seen before):\n   -
      Calculate remaining number of cycles\n   - Fast-forward to the same point in
      the last cycle\n3. Finish simulating any remaining steps\n4. Output the final
      port\n\nThe time complexity will be O(M * N) and space complexity O(M * N) to

      3: Luxury River Cruise [Josh Alman and Nathan Pinsker, 2013]\n\nFarmer John
      is taking Bessie and the cows on a cruise! They are sailing on a \nnetwork of
      rivers with N ports (1 <= N <= 1,000) labeled 1..N, and Bessie \nstarts at port
      1. Each port has exactly two rivers leading out of it which \nlead directly
      to other ports, and rivers can only be sailed one way.\n\nAt each port, the
      tour guides choose either the \"left\" river or the \"right\" \nriver to sail
      down next, but they keep repeating the same choices over and \nover. More specifically,
      the tour guides have chosen a short sequence of M \ndirections (1 <= M <= 500),
      each either \"left\" or \"right\", and have\nrepeated it K times (1 <= K <=
      1,000,000,000). Bessie thinks she is going\nin circles -- help her figure out

      problem involves simulating movement through a network of ports based on a repeating
      sequence of left/right directions. The key aspects are:\n1. The network of ports
      is represented as a graph, where each port has a \"left\" and \"right\" outgoing
      edge to other ports. \n2. A sequence of M left/right directions is given, which
      is repeated K times.\n3. We need to determine the final port after following
      this repeated sequence starting from port 1.\n\nTo solve this, we can:\n1. Read
      in the port graph and store the left/right destinations for each port\n2. Simulate
      the movement:\n   - Maintain a current port\n   - For each direction in the
      sequence:\n     - If ''L'', move to the left port, else move to the right port\n   -
      Repeat the sequence K times in total\n3. Output the final port\n\nThe number
      of repetitions K can be very large (up to 1 billion), so we need to find a way
      to avoid simulating all K repetitions. \n\nOne optimization is to notice that
      if we ever visit the same port twice at the same point in the direction sequence,
      we have entered a cycle. We can fast-forward by calculating how many full cycles
      are left.\n\nSo an optimized approach would be:\n1. Simulate the first M * N
      steps, keeping track of the port and position in the sequence for each step\n2.
      If a cycle is detected (same port and sequence position seen before):\n   -
      Calculate remaining number of cycles\n   - Fast-forward to the same point in
      the last cycle\n3. Finish simulating any remaining steps\n4. Output the final
      port\n\nThe time complexity will be O(M * N) and space complexity O(M * N) to
      store the state at each step for cycle detection.\n</thinking>","type":"text"},{"id":"toolu_01TCbGzzL5B2sa5xFezRTVMJ","input":{"reasoning":"We

      problem involves simulating movement through a network of ports based on a repeating
      sequence of left/right directions. The key aspects are:\n1. The network of ports
      is represented as a graph, where each port has a \"left\" and \"right\" outgoing
      edge to other ports. \n2. A sequence of M left/right directions is given, which
      is repeated K times.\n3. We need to determine the final port after following
      this repeated sequence starting from port 1.\n\nTo solve this, we can:\n1. Read
      in the port graph and store the left/right destinations for each port\n2. Simulate
      the movement:\n   - Maintain a current port\n   - For each direction in the
      sequence:\n     - If ''L'', move to the left port, else move to the right port\n   -
      Repeat the sequence K times in total\n3. Output the final port\n\nThe number
      of repetitions K can be very large (up to 1 billion), so we need to find a way
      to avoid simulating all K repetitions. \n\nOne optimization is to notice that
      if we ever visit the same port twice at the same point in the direction sequence,
      we have entered a cycle. We can fast-forward by calculating how many full cycles
      are left.\n\nSo an optimized approach would be:\n1. Simulate the first M * N
      steps, keeping track of the port and position in the sequence for each step\n2.
      If a cycle is detected (same port and sequence position seen before):\n   -
      Calculate remaining number of cycles\n   - Fast-forward to the same point in
      the last cycle\n3. Finish simulating any remaining steps\n4. Output the final
      port\n\nThe time complexity will be O(M * N) and space complexity O(M * N) to
      store the state at each step for cycle detection.\n</thinking>","type":"text"},{"id":"toolu_01TCbGzzL5B2sa5xFezRTVMJ","input":{"reasoning":"We

      positions \nlabeled from\n$1\\dots N$.\n\nSince all the cows are hungry, FJ
      decides to plant grassy patches on some\nof the positions $1\\dots N$. Guernseys
      and Holsteins prefer different types of\ngrass, so if Farmer John decides to
      plant grass at some location, he must choose\nto planting either Guernsey-preferred
      grass or Holstein-preferred grass --- he\ncannot plant both at the same location.
      Each patch of grass planted can feed an\nunlimited number of cows of the appropriate
      breed. \n\nEach cow is willing to move a maximum of $K$ ($0 \\le {K} \\le N-1$)
      positions to\nreach a patch. Find the minimum number of patches needed to feed
      all the cows.\nAlso, print a configuration of patches that uses the minimum
      amount of patches\nneeded to feed the cows. Any configuration that satisfies
      the above conditions\nwill be considered correct.\n\nINPUT FORMAT (input arrives
      from the terminal / stdin):\nEach input contains $T$ test cases, each describing
      an arrangement of cows. The\nfirst line of input contains $T$ ($1 \\le T \\le
      10$). Each of the $T$ test cases\nfollow.\n\nEach test case starts with a line
      containing $N$ and $K$. The next line will\ncontain a string of length $N$,
      where each character denotes the breed of the\n$i$th cow (G meaning Guernsey
      and H meaning Holstein).\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):\nFor
      each of the $T$ test cases, please write two lines of output. For the first\nline,
      print the minimum number of patches needed to feed the cows. For the\nsecond
      line, print a string of length $N$ that describes a configuration  that\nfeeds
      all the cows with the minimum number of patches. The $i$th character,\ndescribing
      the $i$th position, should be a ''.'' if there is no patch, a ''G'' if\nthere
      is a patch that feeds Guernseys, and a ''H'' if it feeds Holsteins. Any\nvalid
      configuration will be accepted.\n\nSAMPLE INPUT:\n6\n5 0\nGHHGG\n5 1\nGHHGG\n5

      that for some test cases, there are multiple acceptable configurations that\nmanage
      to feed all cows while using the minimum number of patches. For example,\nin
      the fourth test case, another acceptable answer would be:\n\n\n.GH..\n\nThis
      corresponds to placing a patch feeding Guernseys on the 2nd position and a\npatch
      feeding Holsteins on the third position. This uses the optimal number of\npatches
      and ensures that all cows are within 3 positions of a patch they prefer.\n\n\n\nSCORING:\nInputs

      by Mythreya Dharani)\nLet''s start by defining a cow as covered if there is
      a patch feeding its\nbreed within a distance of $K$. The problem is asking us
      to cover all cows with\nthe minimum number of patches.\nConsider each cow $i$
      from $1 \\dots N$ in that order, placing patches whenever\nnecessary. First
      of all, if the current cow is already covered,  then we don''t\nneed to place
      another patch, and we can just move on. Otherwise, we need to\nplace a new patch
      for this cow, so where would we place it? Consider what\nhappens if we place
      the patch at position $i + K$. Not only will cow $i$ be\ncovered but any cows
      after it which are within $K$ distance of that patch will\nalso be covered.
      In fact, placing it at this location maximizes the number of\npotential cows
      that can be covered. \nThus, we can just implement this strategy starting at
      cow $1$. Keep in mind that\nif there is a cow $i$ which needs to be fed and
      $i + K > N$, we can just place\nour new patch at position $i$ since all remaining
      same-breed cows can feed off\nthat patch. This solution runs in $O(N)$ time
      since we are just doing a single\npass over the $N$ cows.\nThere is actually
      one edge case; what if when we try to place a patch at\nposition $i$ but there
      is already a patch there? In this case, we can place the\npatch at $i-1$ instead,
      as it may be proven that there can''t already be patches\nat both $i-1$ and
      $i$. As $i-1+K\\ge N$, this patch covers all cows from $i$ to\n$N$ of the same
      breed as cow $i$.\nMythreya Dharani''s C++ code:\n\n#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing

      by Rain Jiang, Benjamin Qi)\nRestating the problem:\nYou are given an undirected
      graph, such that each edge belongs to at most one\nsimple cycle. Such a graph
      is called a\ncactus.\nYou start walking at vertex $1$. Every time you are at
      any vertex $i$, do the\nfollowing:\nWith a probability of $p_i$, end the walk.Otherwise,
      if there are no untraversed edges adjacent to $i$, end the\nwalk.Otherwise,
      choose an untraversed edge adjacent to $i$ uniformly randomly,\nand traverse
      it.\nFor all vertices $i$, you want to find the probability that you end your
      walk at\n$i$. Let''s call this probability $ans_i$.\nLet $d_i$ be $\\deg(i)$
      if $i=1$, and $\\deg(i)-1$ otherwise.\nLet $K$ be the maximum number of cycles
      that any vertex belongs to.\nSubtask 1: $N \\le 11$.\nFrom $N \\le 11$, we can
      see that\n$M \\le \\frac{3}{2} (N - 1) \\le \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot 10 = 15$.\nWith
      these bounds, an $O(2^M \\cdot M)$ DP is sufficient.\nLet $dp_{i, E}$ be the
      probability that you reach a state where you''re at vertex\n$i$, and the set
      of untraversed edges is $E$.\nLet''s see how to transition from $dp_{i, E}$
      to other states.\nLet $E''$ be the set of edges in $E$ adjacent to $i$.\nIf
      $E''$ is empty, we add $dp_{i, E}$ to $ans_i$.\nOtherwise, we add $dp_{i, E}
      \\cdot p_i$ to $ans_i$. Also, for each edge\n$e = \\{i, j\\} \\in E''$ adjacent
      to $i$, we add\n$dp_{i, E} \\cdot (1 - p_i) \\cdot \\frac{1}{|E''|}$ to\n$dp_{j,
      E \\setminus \\{e\\}}$,\nBecause the time spent on transitions from any $dp_{i,
      E}$ is $O(\\deg(i))$, and\nthe sum of $\\deg(i)$ is $O(M)$, the total time taken

      all\nof Bessie''s possible walks. The number of walks is bounded above by\n$N\\cdot
      3^{(\\#\\text{ simple cycles})}\\cdot \\prod_{1\\le i\\le N}(\\#\\text{ simple
      cycles adjacent to }i)!$\nbecause if we:\nFix Bessie''s ending vertex (choices:
      $N$)For each simple cycle, decide which direction to traverse it in, or not\ntraverse
      it at all (choices: $3^{(\\#\\text{ simple cycles})}$)For each vertex, decide
      in what order we will traverse the simple cycles\nadjacent to it (choices:\n$\\prod_{1\\le
      i\\le N}(\\#\\text{ simple cycles adjacent to }i)!$).\nthen Bessie''s walk is
      uniquely determined. For $N\\le 11$, the number of simple\ncycles is at most  $(N-1)/2\\le
      5$, so the total number of walks cannot be very\nlarge.\nSubtask 3: $K \\le
      1$.\nThe graph is a vertex-disjoint cactus. We need to modify the algorithm
      from\nSubtask 2 to handle cycles.\nAgain, root the cactus at vertex $1$, and
      consider the\nDFS tree of this cactus. Since we\ndid DFS, each cycle can be
      represented as path from a vertex to one of its\ndescendants, plus the corresponding
      back edge. Let''s call this highest vertex\nthe top vertex of the cycle.\nYou
      can see that the path generally moves downward, with occasional roundabouts\nalong
      cycles.\nSimilar to Subtask 2, let $pVisit_i$ be the probability that you reach
      vertex\n$i$ from the root.\nThe transitions using a non-cycle edge can be handled
      similar to Subtask 2.\nLet''s see how to transition using cycle edges. Let $i$
      be the top vertex of\ncycle $C$.\nWe describe how to transition from $i$ to
      another vertex $j$ on cycle $C$. We\ncan see that $pVisit_j$ is the sum of the
      two probabilities of going from $i$ to\n$j$, by choosing one of two paths going
      from $i$ to $j$ along $C$. The\nprobability of traversing one such path is the
      product of $pVisit_i$ and\n$(1 - p_u) \\cdot \\frac{1}{d_u}$ for all vertices
      $u$ along that path.\nYou should also handle the special case of traversing
      the whole cycle $C$ and\nvisiting $i$ a second time. The probability of this
      occurring is similar to the\nabove. After we traverse $C$, there are no more
      cycle edges adjacent to $i$, so\nwe are forced to either stop at $i$ or traverse
      an adjacent non-cycle edge.\nWe can do this using a DFS from vertex $1$. We
      process each cycle $C$ by going\nthrough it twice, once in each direction, taking
      $O(|C|)$ time.\nTime complexity: $O(M)$.\nRain''s code:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include

      5, 6\nAs in earlier subtasks, root the cactus at vertex $1$ and consider the
      DFS tree\nof it.\nHowever, the path is more complex: it can go down the tree
      for quite a while,\nbut eventually retrace and traverse another path.\nLet''s
      define a few terms. Fix vertex $i$. Consider the edge $f$ from $i$ to its\nparent.
      By the assumption that the graph is a cactus, $f$ must either be a\nbridge or
      is\ncontained in a (unique) cycle $C$. (From now on, when we say \"bridge\",
      we mean\nit in the graph theory sense.) If $f$ is a bridge, then call $pb_i=f$
      the\nparent bridge of $i$. Otherwise, call $pc_i=C$ the parent cycle of\n$i$.\nIn
      any case, let the predecessor of vertex $i$ be either its parent (if\n$f$ is
      a bridge) or the top vertex of $pc_i$ (if $f$ isn''t a bridge.)\nSymmetrically,
      $i$ is a successor of its predecessor.\nAlso, let the subcactus of $i$ be the
      connected subgraph containing $i$\nobtained by deleting $pb_i$ or all edges
      of $pc_i$. Let $T_i$ be the subcactus\nof $i$.\nLet''s observe what edges adjacent
      to vertex $i$ are untraversed when we visit\n$i$ for the first time. Consider
      two cases (recall that $f$ is the edge from $i$\nto its parent):\n\n$f$ is a
      bridge. If $i \\neq 1$, the only way to visit $i$ is through\n$pb_i$. We cannot
      use $pb_i$ twice, so we must stay in $T_i$ from now on.\n\n$f$ is not a bridge.
      We must enter $i$ via one of two adjacent edges in\n$pc_i$. In either case,
      all untraversed edges from $i$ are in $T_i$, except the\nother cycle edge. Indeed,
      this edge is the only edge that can be used to escape\n$T_i$, and once we use
      it, we can never go back to any vertex in $T_i$. We refer\nto this edge as the
      \"escape edge\" of $i$.\n\nThis motivates us to compute the following two DPs:\n$pEscape_i$
      -- the probability that, starting from $i$, we eventually use the\n\"escape
      edge\" from $i$ (For convenience later, let $pEscape_i = 0$ if there is\nno
      such \"escape edge\".)\n$qVisit_{i, j}$ -- the probability that, starting from
      $i$, we visit one of its\nsuccessors $j$.\nIf we have these two DPs, we can
      compute the answer using a DFS from vertex $1$\nas follows.\nSuppose the DFS
      reaches $i$. Let $pVisit_i$ be defined similar to Subtasks 2 and\n3.\nFor a
      successor $j$ of $i$, set $pVisit_j = pVisit_i \\cdot qVisit_{i, j}$, and\nrecurse
      on $j$.\nFinally, let''s compute $ans_i$. You end up at vertex $i$ if you visit
      vertex\n$i$, and you don''t do either of the following:\n\nUse the \"escape
      edge\" from $i$.\n\nEventually reach a successor $j$, and never escape from
      its subcactus.\n\nSince all bad cases above are mutually exclusive, we have\n$$\nans_i
      = pVisit_i \\cdot \\left(1 - pEscape_i - \\sum_{j\\:\\textrm{is a successor
      of}\\:i} qVisit_{i, j} \\left(1 - pEscape_j\\right)\\right)\n$$\nSince each
      vertex has a unique predecessor, the time to compute $ans_i$ from\n$pEscape$
      and $qVisit$ is $O(M)$.\nLet''s compute $pEscape$ and $qVisit$ in a bottom-up
      fashion. Suppose we want to\ncompute them for $i$.\nLet $qEscape_C$ for a cycle
      $C$ with top vertex $i$ be equal to the product of\n$pEscape_j$ for all vertices
      $j \\in C$ excluding $i$. In other words, this is\nthe probability that you
      can complete one traversal of $C$ from $i$ and end up\nback at $i$. \nLet $CC$
      be the set of cycles that $i$ is the top vertex of.\nThere are two things we
      need to calculate:\n$pChoose_{bridge}$ -- The probability of eventually choosing
      a certain bridge\nadjacent to $i$ (or the \"escape edge\" of $i$).\n$pChoose_C$
      -- The probability of eventually choosing one of two edges adjacent\nto $i$
      on a cycle\n$C \\in CC$.\nUsing these, we can compute $pEscape_i$ and $qVisit_{i,
      j}$ as follows:\n\n$qVisit_{i, j}$ on bridges $\\{i, j\\}$ (and $pEscape_i$,
      if there is an \"escape\nedge\") are equal to $pChoose_{bridge}$.\n\nWe are
      left with computing $qVisit_{i, j}$ for all $j$ on a cycle $C \\in CC$.\nAny
      corresponding path must eventually select one of two edges adjacent to $i$\non
      $C$, and traverse the path from $i$ to $j$ along that edge. The probability\nof
      this happening is the product of $pChoose_C$ and $pEscape_{u}$ for all $u$\nalong
      this path. So $qVisit_{i, j}$ can be computed in a similar way as in\nSubtask
      3.\n\nThe next few paragraphs describe how to compute $pChoose_{bridge}$ and\n$pChoose_C$
      for $C \\in CC$ fast.\nLet''s consider $pChoose_{bridge}$. Any corresponding
      path can be described as a\ntraversal of some subset of cycles $C_0, C_1, ...,
      C_{k-1}$, in this order, plus\nthe extra edge.\nSo $pChoose_{bridge}$ is the
      sum of the following over all ordered subsets\n$C_0, C_1, ..., C_{k-1}$:\n$$\n\\left(\\prod_{h=0}^{k-1}
      \\left(1 - p_i\\right) \\cdot \\frac{2}{d_i-2h} \\cdot qEscape_{C_h}\\right)
      \\cdot \\left(1 - p_i\\right) \\cdot \\frac{1}{d_i-2k}\n$$\nAlso, the above
      term doesn''t change if we permute $C_0, C_1, ..., C_{k-1}$, so\nlet''s instead
      sum over all subsets $S \\subseteq CC$:\n$$\npChoose_{bridge} = \\sum_{S \\subseteq
      CC} \\left(k! \\cdot \\left(1 - p_i\\right)^{k+1} \\cdot 2^k \\cdot \\left(\\prod_{h=0}^{k}
      \\frac{1}{d_i-2h}\\right) \\cdot \\prod_{C \\in S} qEscape_{C}\\right)\n$$\n$pChoose_C$
      for $C \\in CC$ can be calculated in the same way, except that in the\nabove
      formula we use $CC \\setminus \\{C\\}$ instead of $CC$.\nCalculating the above
      sums straightforwardly takes $O(2^K \\cdot K^2)$ time, and\nthis passes Subtask
      4 where $K \\le 5$.\nLet''s make it faster. Note that the terms with the same
      $k$ in the above formula\nhave a common factor, namely\n$w_k = k! \\cdot (1
      - p_i)^{k+1} \\cdot 2^k \\cdot (\\prod_{h=0}^{k} \\frac{1}{d_i-2h})$.\nFactoring
      this out, it suffices to compute the sum of\n$\\prod_{C \\in S} qEscape_{C}$
      for all subsets $S \\in CC$ of size $k$.\nWe can do this using generating functions.
      Consider the generating function\n$$\nF(x) = \\prod_{C \\in CC} \\left(1 + qEscape_C
      x\\right)\n$$\nOnce we get this generating function, we add $w_k \\cdot F(x)
      [x^k]$ for all $k$\nto get $pChoose_{bridge}$. We can calculate $pChoose_C$
      for $C \\in CC$\nsimilarly, except that we use $CC \\setminus \\{C\\}$ instead
      of $CC$.\nThe generating function has degree $K$, so multiplying $(1 + qEscape_C
      x)$ takes\n$O(K)$ time. Thus it takes $O(K^2)$ time to calculate $F(x)$, and
      doing this for\nall $O(K)$ probabilities takes $O(K^3)$.\nThe sum of $K$ is

      we need to compute $pChoose_{bridge}$ and $pChoose_C$ in\n$O(K^2)$ time.\nNotice
      that the generating function we calculate for $pChoose_C$ is almost the\nsame
      as the one for $pChoose_{bridge}$, but is missing a factor of\n$(1 + qEscape_C
      x)$. This factor can be removed in $O(K)$ time (To divide such a\npolynomial,
      we perform steps backward as when we multiply.)\nIn summary, we spend $O(K)$
      divisions and multiplications, $O(K)$ time for\ncomputing $O(K)$ probabilities
      from the generating function, so in total we\nspend $O(K^2)$ time to compute
      $pChoose_{bridge}$ and $pChoose_C$.\nSumming $K^2$ over all vertices $i$, we
      get a time of $O(N^2)$, which gets full\ncredit.\nA full solution by Rain:\n\n#include

      3: Luxury River Cruise [Josh Alman and Nathan Pinsker, 2013]\n\nFarmer John
      is taking Bessie and the cows on a cruise! They are sailing on a \nnetwork of
      rivers with N ports (1 <= N <= 1,000) labeled 1..N, and Bessie \nstarts at port
      1. Each port has exactly two rivers leading out of it which \nlead directly
      to other ports, and rivers can only be sailed one way.\n\nAt each port, the
      tour guides choose either the \"left\" river or the \"right\" \nriver to sail
      down next, but they keep repeating the same choices over and \nover. More specifically,
      the tour guides have chosen a short sequence of M \ndirections (1 <= M <= 500),
      each either \"left\" or \"right\", and have\nrepeated it K times (1 <= K <=
      1,000,000,000). Bessie thinks she is going\nin circles -- help her figure out

      problem involves simulating movement through a network of ports based on a repeating
      sequence of left/right directions. The key aspects are:\n1. The network of ports
      is represented as a graph, where each port has a \"left\" and \"right\" outgoing
      edge to other ports. \n2. A sequence of M left/right directions is given, which
      is repeated K times.\n3. We need to determine the final port after following
      this repeated sequence starting from port 1.\n\nTo solve this, we can:\n1. Read
      in the port graph and store the left/right destinations for each port\n2. Simulate
      the movement:\n   - Maintain a current port\n   - For each direction in the
      sequence:\n     - If ''L'', move to the left port, else move to the right port\n   -
      Repeat the sequence K times in total\n3. Output the final port\n\nThe number
      of repetitions K can be very large (up to 1 billion), so we need to find a way
      to avoid simulating all K repetitions. \n\nOne optimization is to notice that
      if we ever visit the same port twice at the same point in the direction sequence,
      we have entered a cycle. We can fast-forward by calculating how many full cycles
      are left.\n\nSo an optimized approach would be:\n1. Simulate the first M * N
      steps, keeping track of the port and position in the sequence for each step\n2.
      If a cycle is detected (same port and sequence position seen before):\n   -
      Calculate remaining number of cycles\n   - Fast-forward to the same point in
      the last cycle\n3. Finish simulating any remaining steps\n4. Output the final
      port\n\nThe time complexity will be O(M * N) and space complexity O(M * N) to
      store the state at each step for cycle detection.\n</thinking>","type":"text"},{"id":"toolu_01TCbGzzL5B2sa5xFezRTVMJ","input":{"reasoning":"We

      of previously seen (port, sequence position) states\n3. When a cycle is detected,
      fast-forward to near the end by skipping full cycles\n\nTime Complexity: O(M

      3: Luxury River Cruise [Josh Alman and Nathan Pinsker, 2013]\n\nFarmer John

      1. Each port has exactly two rivers leading out of it which \nlead directly
      to other ports, and rivers can only be sailed one way.\n\nAt each port, the
      tour guides choose either the \"left\" river or the \"right\" \nriver to sail
      down next, but they keep repeating the same choices over and \nover. More specifically,
      the tour guides have chosen a short sequence of M \ndirections (1 <= M <= 500),
      each either \"left\" or \"right\", and have\nrepeated it K times (1 <= K <=
      1,000,000,000). Bessie thinks she is going\nin circles -- help her figure out

      problem involves simulating movement through a network of ports based on a repeating
      sequence of left/right directions. The key aspects are:\n1. The network of ports
      is represented as a graph, where each port has a \"left\" and \"right\" outgoing
      edge to other ports. \n2. A sequence of M left/right directions is given, which
      is repeated K times.\n3. We need to determine the final port after following
      this repeated sequence starting from port 1.\n\nTo solve this, we can:\n1. Read
      in the port graph and store the left/right destinations for each port\n2. Simulate
      the movement:\n   - Maintain a current port\n   - For each direction in the
      sequence:\n     - If ''L'', move to the left port, else move to the right port\n   -
      Repeat the sequence K times in total\n3. Output the final port\n\nThe number
      of repetitions K can be very large (up to 1 billion), so we need to find a way
      to avoid simulating all K repetitions. \n\nOne optimization is to notice that
      if we ever visit the same port twice at the same point in the direction sequence,
      we have entered a cycle. We can fast-forward by calculating how many full cycles
      are left.\n\nSo an optimized approach would be:\n1. Simulate the first M * N
      steps, keeping track of the port and position in the sequence for each step\n2.
      If a cycle is detected (same port and sequence position seen before):\n   -
      Calculate remaining number of cycles\n   - Fast-forward to the same point in
      the last cycle\n3. Finish simulating any remaining steps\n4. Output the final
      port\n\nThe time complexity will be O(M * N) and space complexity O(M * N) to

      previously solved the following problems in this competition:\n    <Examples>\n    <problem>\n    Farmer
      John has $N$ ($1 \\le {N} \\le {10^5}$) cows, the breed of each being\neither
      a Guernsey or a Holstein. They have lined up horizontally with the cows occupying
      positions \nlabeled from\n$1\\dots N$.\n\nSince all the cows are hungry, FJ
      decides to plant grassy patches on some\nof the positions $1\\dots N$. Guernseys
      and Holsteins prefer different types of\ngrass, so if Farmer John decides to
      plant grass at some location, he must choose\nto planting either Guernsey-preferred
      grass or Holstein-preferred grass --- he\ncannot plant both at the same location.
      Each patch of grass planted can feed an\nunlimited number of cows of the appropriate
      breed. \n\nEach cow is willing to move a maximum of $K$ ($0 \\le {K} \\le N-1$)
      positions to\nreach a patch. Find the minimum number of patches needed to feed
      all the cows.\nAlso, print a configuration of patches that uses the minimum

      all the cows with the minimum number of patches. The $i$th character,\ndescribing
      the $i$th position, should be a ''.'' if there is no patch, a ''G'' if\nthere
      is a patch that feeds Guernseys, and a ''H'' if it feeds Holsteins. Any\nvalid

      to feed all cows while using the minimum number of patches. For example,\nin
      the fourth test case, another acceptable answer would be:\n\n\n.GH..\n\nThis
      corresponds to placing a patch feeding Guernseys on the 2nd position and a\npatch
      feeding Holsteins on the third position. This uses the optimal number of\npatches
      and ensures that all cows are within 3 positions of a patch they prefer.\n\n\n\nSCORING:\nInputs

      by Mythreya Dharani)\nLet''s start by defining a cow as covered if there is
      a patch feeding its\nbreed within a distance of $K$. The problem is asking us
      to cover all cows with\nthe minimum number of patches.\nConsider each cow $i$
      from $1 \\dots N$ in that order, placing patches whenever\nnecessary. First
      of all, if the current cow is already covered,  then we don''t\nneed to place
      another patch, and we can just move on. Otherwise, we need to\nplace a new patch
      for this cow, so where would we place it? Consider what\nhappens if we place
      the patch at position $i + K$. Not only will cow $i$ be\ncovered but any cows
      after it which are within $K$ distance of that patch will\nalso be covered.
      In fact, placing it at this location maximizes the number of\npotential cows
      that can be covered. \nThus, we can just implement this strategy starting at
      cow $1$. Keep in mind that\nif there is a cow $i$ which needs to be fed and
      $i + K > N$, we can just place\nour new patch at position $i$ since all remaining
      same-breed cows can feed off\nthat patch. This solution runs in $O(N)$ time
      since we are just doing a single\npass over the $N$ cows.\nThere is actually
      one edge case; what if when we try to place a patch at\nposition $i$ but there
      is already a patch there? In this case, we can place the\npatch at $i-1$ instead,
      as it may be proven that there can''t already be patches\nat both $i-1$ and
      $i$. As $i-1+K\\ge N$, this patch covers all cows from $i$ to\n$N$ of the same
      breed as cow $i$.\nMythreya Dharani''s C++ code:\n\n#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing

      any vertex $i$, do the\nfollowing:\nWith a probability of $p_i$, end the walk.Otherwise,
      if there are no untraversed edges adjacent to $i$, end the\nwalk.Otherwise,
      choose an untraversed edge adjacent to $i$ uniformly randomly,\nand traverse
      it.\nFor all vertices $i$, you want to find the probability that you end your
      walk at\n$i$. Let''s call this probability $ans_i$.\nLet $d_i$ be $\\deg(i)$
      if $i=1$, and $\\deg(i)-1$ otherwise.\nLet $K$ be the maximum number of cycles
      that any vertex belongs to.\nSubtask 1: $N \\le 11$.\nFrom $N \\le 11$, we can
      see that\n$M \\le \\frac{3}{2} (N - 1) \\le \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot 10 = 15$.\nWith
      these bounds, an $O(2^M \\cdot M)$ DP is sufficient.\nLet $dp_{i, E}$ be the
      probability that you reach a state where you''re at vertex\n$i$, and the set
      of untraversed edges is $E$.\nLet''s see how to transition from $dp_{i, E}$
      to other states.\nLet $E''$ be the set of edges in $E$ adjacent to $i$.\nIf
      $E''$ is empty, we add $dp_{i, E}$ to $ans_i$.\nOtherwise, we add $dp_{i, E}
      \\cdot p_i$ to $ans_i$. Also, for each edge\n$e = \\{i, j\\} \\in E''$ adjacent
      to $i$, we add\n$dp_{i, E} \\cdot (1 - p_i) \\cdot \\frac{1}{|E''|}$ to\n$dp_{j,
      E \\setminus \\{e\\}}$,\nBecause the time spent on transitions from any $dp_{i,
      E}$ is $O(\\deg(i))$, and\nthe sum of $\\deg(i)$ is $O(M)$, the total time taken
      for this DP is\n$O(2^M \\cdot M)$.\nRain''s code:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include

      all\nof Bessie''s possible walks. The number of walks is bounded above by\n$N\\cdot
      3^{(\\#\\text{ simple cycles})}\\cdot \\prod_{1\\le i\\le N}(\\#\\text{ simple
      cycles adjacent to }i)!$\nbecause if we:\nFix Bessie''s ending vertex (choices:
      $N$)For each simple cycle, decide which direction to traverse it in, or not\ntraverse
      it at all (choices: $3^{(\\#\\text{ simple cycles})}$)For each vertex, decide
      in what order we will traverse the simple cycles\nadjacent to it (choices:\n$\\prod_{1\\le
      i\\le N}(\\#\\text{ simple cycles adjacent to }i)!$).\nthen Bessie''s walk is
      uniquely determined. For $N\\le 11$, the number of simple\ncycles is at most  $(N-1)/2\\le
      5$, so the total number of walks cannot be very\nlarge.\nSubtask 3: $K \\le
      1$.\nThe graph is a vertex-disjoint cactus. We need to modify the algorithm
      from\nSubtask 2 to handle cycles.\nAgain, root the cactus at vertex $1$, and
      consider the\nDFS tree of this cactus. Since we\ndid DFS, each cycle can be
      represented as path from a vertex to one of its\ndescendants, plus the corresponding
      back edge. Let''s call this highest vertex\nthe top vertex of the cycle.\nYou
      can see that the path generally moves downward, with occasional roundabouts\nalong
      cycles.\nSimilar to Subtask 2, let $pVisit_i$ be the probability that you reach
      vertex\n$i$ from the root.\nThe transitions using a non-cycle edge can be handled
      similar to Subtask 2.\nLet''s see how to transition using cycle edges. Let $i$
      be the top vertex of\ncycle $C$.\nWe describe how to transition from $i$ to
      another vertex $j$ on cycle $C$. We\ncan see that $pVisit_j$ is the sum of the
      two probabilities of going from $i$ to\n$j$, by choosing one of two paths going
      from $i$ to $j$ along $C$. The\nprobability of traversing one such path is the
      product of $pVisit_i$ and\n$(1 - p_u) \\cdot \\frac{1}{d_u}$ for all vertices
      $u$ along that path.\nYou should also handle the special case of traversing
      the whole cycle $C$ and\nvisiting $i$ a second time. The probability of this
      occurring is similar to the\nabove. After we traverse $C$, there are no more
      cycle edges adjacent to $i$, so\nwe are forced to either stop at $i$ or traverse
      an adjacent non-cycle edge.\nWe can do this using a DFS from vertex $1$. We
      process each cycle $C$ by going\nthrough it twice, once in each direction, taking
      $O(|C|)$ time.\nTime complexity: $O(M)$.\nRain''s code:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include

      5, 6\nAs in earlier subtasks, root the cactus at vertex $1$ and consider the
      DFS tree\nof it.\nHowever, the path is more complex: it can go down the tree
      for quite a while,\nbut eventually retrace and traverse another path.\nLet''s
      define a few terms. Fix vertex $i$. Consider the edge $f$ from $i$ to its\nparent.
      By the assumption that the graph is a cactus, $f$ must either be a\nbridge or
      is\ncontained in a (unique) cycle $C$. (From now on, when we say \"bridge\",
      we mean\nit in the graph theory sense.) If $f$ is a bridge, then call $pb_i=f$
      the\nparent bridge of $i$. Otherwise, call $pc_i=C$ the parent cycle of\n$i$.\nIn
      any case, let the predecessor of vertex $i$ be either its parent (if\n$f$ is
      a bridge) or the top vertex of $pc_i$ (if $f$ isn''t a bridge.)\nSymmetrically,
      $i$ is a successor of its predecessor.\nAlso, let the subcactus of $i$ be the
      connected subgraph containing $i$\nobtained by deleting $pb_i$ or all edges
      of $pc_i$. Let $T_i$ be the subcactus\nof $i$.\nLet''s observe what edges adjacent
      to vertex $i$ are untraversed when we visit\n$i$ for the first time. Consider
      two cases (recall that $f$ is the edge from $i$\nto its parent):\n\n$f$ is a
      bridge. If $i \\neq 1$, the only way to visit $i$ is through\n$pb_i$. We cannot
      use $pb_i$ twice, so we must stay in $T_i$ from now on.\n\n$f$ is not a bridge.
      We must enter $i$ via one of two adjacent edges in\n$pc_i$. In either case,
      all untraversed edges from $i$ are in $T_i$, except the\nother cycle edge. Indeed,
      this edge is the only edge that can be used to escape\n$T_i$, and once we use
      it, we can never go back to any vertex in $T_i$. We refer\nto this edge as the
      \"escape edge\" of $i$.\n\nThis motivates us to compute the following two DPs:\n$pEscape_i$
      -- the probability that, starting from $i$, we eventually use the\n\"escape
      edge\" from $i$ (For convenience later, let $pEscape_i = 0$ if there is\nno
      such \"escape edge\".)\n$qVisit_{i, j}$ -- the probability that, starting from
      $i$, we visit one of its\nsuccessors $j$.\nIf we have these two DPs, we can
      compute the answer using a DFS from vertex $1$\nas follows.\nSuppose the DFS
      reaches $i$. Let $pVisit_i$ be defined similar to Subtasks 2 and\n3.\nFor a
      successor $j$ of $i$, set $pVisit_j = pVisit_i \\cdot qVisit_{i, j}$, and\nrecurse
      on $j$.\nFinally, let''s compute $ans_i$. You end up at vertex $i$ if you visit
      vertex\n$i$, and you don''t do either of the following:\n\nUse the \"escape
      edge\" from $i$.\n\nEventually reach a successor $j$, and never escape from
      its subcactus.\n\nSince all bad cases above are mutually exclusive, we have\n$$\nans_i
      = pVisit_i \\cdot \\left(1 - pEscape_i - \\sum_{j\\:\\textrm{is a successor
      of}\\:i} qVisit_{i, j} \\left(1 - pEscape_j\\right)\\right)\n$$\nSince each
      vertex has a unique predecessor, the time to compute $ans_i$ from\n$pEscape$
      and $qVisit$ is $O(M)$.\nLet''s compute $pEscape$ and $qVisit$ in a bottom-up
      fashion. Suppose we want to\ncompute them for $i$.\nLet $qEscape_C$ for a cycle
      $C$ with top vertex $i$ be equal to the product of\n$pEscape_j$ for all vertices
      $j \\in C$ excluding $i$. In other words, this is\nthe probability that you
      can complete one traversal of $C$ from $i$ and end up\nback at $i$. \nLet $CC$
      be the set of cycles that $i$ is the top vertex of.\nThere are two things we
      need to calculate:\n$pChoose_{bridge}$ -- The probability of eventually choosing
      a certain bridge\nadjacent to $i$ (or the \"escape edge\" of $i$).\n$pChoose_C$
      -- The probability of eventually choosing one of two edges adjacent\nto $i$
      on a cycle\n$C \\in CC$.\nUsing these, we can compute $pEscape_i$ and $qVisit_{i,
      j}$ as follows:\n\n$qVisit_{i, j}$ on bridges $\\{i, j\\}$ (and $pEscape_i$,
      if there is an \"escape\nedge\") are equal to $pChoose_{bridge}$.\n\nWe are
      left with computing $qVisit_{i, j}$ for all $j$ on a cycle $C \\in CC$.\nAny
      corresponding path must eventually select one of two edges adjacent to $i$\non
      $C$, and traverse the path from $i$ to $j$ along that edge. The probability\nof
      this happening is the product of $pChoose_C$ and $pEscape_{u}$ for all $u$\nalong
      this path. So $qVisit_{i, j}$ can be computed in a similar way as in\nSubtask
      3.\n\nThe next few paragraphs describe how to compute $pChoose_{bridge}$ and\n$pChoose_C$
      for $C \\in CC$ fast.\nLet''s consider $pChoose_{bridge}$. Any corresponding
      path can be described as a\ntraversal of some subset of cycles $C_0, C_1, ...,
      C_{k-1}$, in this order, plus\nthe extra edge.\nSo $pChoose_{bridge}$ is the
      sum of the following over all ordered subsets\n$C_0, C_1, ..., C_{k-1}$:\n$$\n\\left(\\prod_{h=0}^{k-1}
      \\left(1 - p_i\\right) \\cdot \\frac{2}{d_i-2h} \\cdot qEscape_{C_h}\\right)
      \\cdot \\left(1 - p_i\\right) \\cdot \\frac{1}{d_i-2k}\n$$\nAlso, the above
      term doesn''t change if we permute $C_0, C_1, ..., C_{k-1}$, so\nlet''s instead
      sum over all subsets $S \\subseteq CC$:\n$$\npChoose_{bridge} = \\sum_{S \\subseteq
      CC} \\left(k! \\cdot \\left(1 - p_i\\right)^{k+1} \\cdot 2^k \\cdot \\left(\\prod_{h=0}^{k}
      \\frac{1}{d_i-2h}\\right) \\cdot \\prod_{C \\in S} qEscape_{C}\\right)\n$$\n$pChoose_C$
      for $C \\in CC$ can be calculated in the same way, except that in the\nabove
      formula we use $CC \\setminus \\{C\\}$ instead of $CC$.\nCalculating the above
      sums straightforwardly takes $O(2^K \\cdot K^2)$ time, and\nthis passes Subtask
      4 where $K \\le 5$.\nLet''s make it faster. Note that the terms with the same
      $k$ in the above formula\nhave a common factor, namely\n$w_k = k! \\cdot (1
      - p_i)^{k+1} \\cdot 2^k \\cdot (\\prod_{h=0}^{k} \\frac{1}{d_i-2h})$.\nFactoring
      this out, it suffices to compute the sum of\n$\\prod_{C \\in S} qEscape_{C}$
      for all subsets $S \\in CC$ of size $k$.\nWe can do this using generating functions.
      Consider the generating function\n$$\nF(x) = \\prod_{C \\in CC} \\left(1 + qEscape_C
      x\\right)\n$$\nOnce we get this generating function, we add $w_k \\cdot F(x)
      [x^k]$ for all $k$\nto get $pChoose_{bridge}$. We can calculate $pChoose_C$
      for $C \\in CC$\nsimilarly, except that we use $CC \\setminus \\{C\\}$ instead
      of $CC$.\nThe generating function has degree $K$, so multiplying $(1 + qEscape_C
      x)$ takes\n$O(K)$ time. Thus it takes $O(K^2)$ time to calculate $F(x)$, and
      doing this for\nall $O(K)$ probabilities takes $O(K^3)$.\nThe sum of $K$ is
      $O(N)$, so the sum of $K^3$ for the above solution is\n$O(N \\cdot K^2)$. This
      is enough to pass subtask 5, where $K \\le 50$.\nRain''s code for Subtask 5:\n\n#include

      we need to compute $pChoose_{bridge}$ and $pChoose_C$ in\n$O(K^2)$ time.\nNotice
      that the generating function we calculate for $pChoose_C$ is almost the\nsame
      as the one for $pChoose_{bridge}$, but is missing a factor of\n$(1 + qEscape_C
      x)$. This factor can be removed in $O(K)$ time (To divide such a\npolynomial,
      we perform steps backward as when we multiply.)\nIn summary, we spend $O(K)$
      divisions and multiplications, $O(K)$ time for\ncomputing $O(K)$ probabilities
      from the generating function, so in total we\nspend $O(K^2)$ time to compute
      $pChoose_{bridge}$ and $pChoose_C$.\nSumming $K^2$ over all vertices $i$, we
      get a time of $O(N^2)$, which gets full\ncredit.\nA full solution by Rain:\n\n#include

      prefer different types of\ngrass, so if Farmer John decides to plant grass at
      some location, he must choose\nto planting either Guernsey-preferred grass or
      Holstein-preferred grass --- he\ncannot plant both at the same location. Each
      patch of grass planted can feed an\nunlimited number of cows of the appropriate
      breed. \n\nEach cow is willing to move a maximum of $K$ ($0 \\le {K} \\le N-1$)
      positions to\nreach a patch. Find the minimum number of patches needed to feed
      all the cows.\nAlso, print a configuration of patches that uses the minimum
      amount of patches\nneeded to feed the cows. Any configuration that satisfies
      the above conditions\nwill be considered correct.\n\nINPUT FORMAT (input arrives
      from the terminal / stdin):\nEach input contains $T$ test cases, each describing
      an arrangement of cows. The\nfirst line of input contains $T$ ($1 \\le T \\le
      10$). Each of the $T$ test cases\nfollow.\n\nEach test case starts with a line
      containing $N$ and $K$. The next line will\ncontain a string of length $N$,
      where each character denotes the breed of the\n$i$th cow (G meaning Guernsey
      and H meaning Holstein).\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):\nFor
      each of the $T$ test cases, please write two lines of output. For the first\nline,
      print the minimum number of patches needed to feed the cows. For the\nsecond
      line, print a string of length $N$ that describes a configuration  that\nfeeds
      all the cows with the minimum number of patches. The $i$th character,\ndescribing
      the $i$th position, should be a ''.'' if there is no patch, a ''G'' if\nthere
      is a patch that feeds Guernseys, and a ''H'' if it feeds Holsteins. Any\nvalid
      configuration will be accepted.\n\nSAMPLE INPUT:\n6\n5 0\nGHHGG\n5 1\nGHHGG\n5

      that for some test cases, there are multiple acceptable configurations that\nmanage
      to feed all cows while using the minimum number of patches. For example,\nin
      the fourth test case, another acceptable answer would be:\n\n\n.GH..\n\nThis
      corresponds to placing a patch feeding Guernseys on the 2nd position and a\npatch
      feeding Holsteins on the third position. This uses the optimal number of\npatches
      and ensures that all cows are within 3 positions of a patch they prefer.\n\n\n\nSCORING:\nInputs

      by Mythreya Dharani)\nLet''s start by defining a cow as covered if there is
      a patch feeding its\nbreed within a distance of $K$. The problem is asking us
      to cover all cows with\nthe minimum number of patches.\nConsider each cow $i$
      from $1 \\dots N$ in that order, placing patches whenever\nnecessary. First
      of all, if the current cow is already covered,  then we don''t\nneed to place
      another patch, and we can just move on. Otherwise, we need to\nplace a new patch
      for this cow, so where would we place it? Consider what\nhappens if we place
      the patch at position $i + K$. Not only will cow $i$ be\ncovered but any cows
      after it which are within $K$ distance of that patch will\nalso be covered.
      In fact, placing it at this location maximizes the number of\npotential cows
      that can be covered. \nThus, we can just implement this strategy starting at
      cow $1$. Keep in mind that\nif there is a cow $i$ which needs to be fed and
      $i + K > N$, we can just place\nour new patch at position $i$ since all remaining
      same-breed cows can feed off\nthat patch. This solution runs in $O(N)$ time
      since we are just doing a single\npass over the $N$ cows.\nThere is actually
      one edge case; what if when we try to place a patch at\nposition $i$ but there
      is already a patch there? In this case, we can place the\npatch at $i-1$ instead,
      as it may be proven that there can''t already be patches\nat both $i-1$ and
      $i$. As $i-1+K\\ge N$, this patch covers all cows from $i$ to\n$N$ of the same
      breed as cow $i$.\nMythreya Dharani''s C++ code:\n\n#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing

      by Rain Jiang, Benjamin Qi)\nRestating the problem:\nYou are given an undirected
      graph, such that each edge belongs to at most one\nsimple cycle. Such a graph
      is called a\ncactus.\nYou start walking at vertex $1$. Every time you are at
      any vertex $i$, do the\nfollowing:\nWith a probability of $p_i$, end the walk.Otherwise,
      if there are no untraversed edges adjacent to $i$, end the\nwalk.Otherwise,
      choose an untraversed edge adjacent to $i$ uniformly randomly,\nand traverse
      it.\nFor all vertices $i$, you want to find the probability that you end your
      walk at\n$i$. Let''s call this probability $ans_i$.\nLet $d_i$ be $\\deg(i)$
      if $i=1$, and $\\deg(i)-1$ otherwise.\nLet $K$ be the maximum number of cycles
      that any vertex belongs to.\nSubtask 1: $N \\le 11$.\nFrom $N \\le 11$, we can
      see that\n$M \\le \\frac{3}{2} (N - 1) \\le \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot 10 = 15$.\nWith
      these bounds, an $O(2^M \\cdot M)$ DP is sufficient.\nLet $dp_{i, E}$ be the
      probability that you reach a state where you''re at vertex\n$i$, and the set
      of untraversed edges is $E$.\nLet''s see how to transition from $dp_{i, E}$
      to other states.\nLet $E''$ be the set of edges in $E$ adjacent to $i$.\nIf
      $E''$ is empty, we add $dp_{i, E}$ to $ans_i$.\nOtherwise, we add $dp_{i, E}
      \\cdot p_i$ to $ans_i$. Also, for each edge\n$e = \\{i, j\\} \\in E''$ adjacent
      to $i$, we add\n$dp_{i, E} \\cdot (1 - p_i) \\cdot \\frac{1}{|E''|}$ to\n$dp_{j,
      E \\setminus \\{e\\}}$,\nBecause the time spent on transitions from any $dp_{i,
      E}$ is $O(\\deg(i))$, and\nthe sum of $\\deg(i)$ is $O(M)$, the total time taken

      all\nof Bessie''s possible walks. The number of walks is bounded above by\n$N\\cdot
      3^{(\\#\\text{ simple cycles})}\\cdot \\prod_{1\\le i\\le N}(\\#\\text{ simple
      cycles adjacent to }i)!$\nbecause if we:\nFix Bessie''s ending vertex (choices:
      $N$)For each simple cycle, decide which direction to traverse it in, or not\ntraverse
      it at all (choices: $3^{(\\#\\text{ simple cycles})}$)For each vertex, decide
      in what order we will traverse the simple cycles\nadjacent to it (choices:\n$\\prod_{1\\le
      i\\le N}(\\#\\text{ simple cycles adjacent to }i)!$).\nthen Bessie''s walk is
      uniquely determined. For $N\\le 11$, the number of simple\ncycles is at most  $(N-1)/2\\le
      5$, so the total number of walks cannot be very\nlarge.\nSubtask 3: $K \\le
      1$.\nThe graph is a vertex-disjoint cactus. We need to modify the algorithm
      from\nSubtask 2 to handle cycles.\nAgain, root the cactus at vertex $1$, and
      consider the\nDFS tree of this cactus. Since we\ndid DFS, each cycle can be
      represented as path from a vertex to one of its\ndescendants, plus the corresponding
      back edge. Let''s call this highest vertex\nthe top vertex of the cycle.\nYou
      can see that the path generally moves downward, with occasional roundabouts\nalong
      cycles.\nSimilar to Subtask 2, let $pVisit_i$ be the probability that you reach
      vertex\n$i$ from the root.\nThe transitions using a non-cycle edge can be handled
      similar to Subtask 2.\nLet''s see how to transition using cycle edges. Let $i$
      be the top vertex of\ncycle $C$.\nWe describe how to transition from $i$ to
      another vertex $j$ on cycle $C$. We\ncan see that $pVisit_j$ is the sum of the
      two probabilities of going from $i$ to\n$j$, by choosing one of two paths going
      from $i$ to $j$ along $C$. The\nprobability of traversing one such path is the
      product of $pVisit_i$ and\n$(1 - p_u) \\cdot \\frac{1}{d_u}$ for all vertices
      $u$ along that path.\nYou should also handle the special case of traversing
      the whole cycle $C$ and\nvisiting $i$ a second time. The probability of this
      occurring is similar to the\nabove. After we traverse $C$, there are no more
      cycle edges adjacent to $i$, so\nwe are forced to either stop at $i$ or traverse
      an adjacent non-cycle edge.\nWe can do this using a DFS from vertex $1$. We
      process each cycle $C$ by going\nthrough it twice, once in each direction, taking
      $O(|C|)$ time.\nTime complexity: $O(M)$.\nRain''s code:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include

      5, 6\nAs in earlier subtasks, root the cactus at vertex $1$ and consider the
      DFS tree\nof it.\nHowever, the path is more complex: it can go down the tree
      for quite a while,\nbut eventually retrace and traverse another path.\nLet''s
      define a few terms. Fix vertex $i$. Consider the edge $f$ from $i$ to its\nparent.
      By the assumption that the graph is a cactus, $f$ must either be a\nbridge or
      is\ncontained in a (unique) cycle $C$. (From now on, when we say \"bridge\",
      we mean\nit in the graph theory sense.) If $f$ is a bridge, then call $pb_i=f$
      the\nparent bridge of $i$. Otherwise, call $pc_i=C$ the parent cycle of\n$i$.\nIn
      any case, let the predecessor of vertex $i$ be either its parent (if\n$f$ is
      a bridge) or the top vertex of $pc_i$ (if $f$ isn''t a bridge.)\nSymmetrically,
      $i$ is a successor of its predecessor.\nAlso, let the subcactus of $i$ be the
      connected subgraph containing $i$\nobtained by deleting $pb_i$ or all edges
      of $pc_i$. Let $T_i$ be the subcactus\nof $i$.\nLet''s observe what edges adjacent
      to vertex $i$ are untraversed when we visit\n$i$ for the first time. Consider
      two cases (recall that $f$ is the edge from $i$\nto its parent):\n\n$f$ is a
      bridge. If $i \\neq 1$, the only way to visit $i$ is through\n$pb_i$. We cannot
      use $pb_i$ twice, so we must stay in $T_i$ from now on.\n\n$f$ is not a bridge.
      We must enter $i$ via one of two adjacent edges in\n$pc_i$. In either case,
      all untraversed edges from $i$ are in $T_i$, except the\nother cycle edge. Indeed,
      this edge is the only edge that can be used to escape\n$T_i$, and once we use
      it, we can never go back to any vertex in $T_i$. We refer\nto this edge as the
      \"escape edge\" of $i$.\n\nThis motivates us to compute the following two DPs:\n$pEscape_i$
      -- the probability that, starting from $i$, we eventually use the\n\"escape
      edge\" from $i$ (For convenience later, let $pEscape_i = 0$ if there is\nno
      such \"escape edge\".)\n$qVisit_{i, j}$ -- the probability that, starting from
      $i$, we visit one of its\nsuccessors $j$.\nIf we have these two DPs, we can
      compute the answer using a DFS from vertex $1$\nas follows.\nSuppose the DFS
      reaches $i$. Let $pVisit_i$ be defined similar to Subtasks 2 and\n3.\nFor a
      successor $j$ of $i$, set $pVisit_j = pVisit_i \\cdot qVisit_{i, j}$, and\nrecurse
      on $j$.\nFinally, let''s compute $ans_i$. You end up at vertex $i$ if you visit
      vertex\n$i$, and you don''t do either of the following:\n\nUse the \"escape
      edge\" from $i$.\n\nEventually reach a successor $j$, and never escape from
      its subcactus.\n\nSince all bad cases above are mutually exclusive, we have\n$$\nans_i
      = pVisit_i \\cdot \\left(1 - pEscape_i - \\sum_{j\\:\\textrm{is a successor
      of}\\:i} qVisit_{i, j} \\left(1 - pEscape_j\\right)\\right)\n$$\nSince each
      vertex has a unique predecessor, the time to compute $ans_i$ from\n$pEscape$
      and $qVisit$ is $O(M)$.\nLet''s compute $pEscape$ and $qVisit$ in a bottom-up
      fashion. Suppose we want to\ncompute them for $i$.\nLet $qEscape_C$ for a cycle
      $C$ with top vertex $i$ be equal to the product of\n$pEscape_j$ for all vertices
      $j \\in C$ excluding $i$. In other words, this is\nthe probability that you
      can complete one traversal of $C$ from $i$ and end up\nback at $i$. \nLet $CC$
      be the set of cycles that $i$ is the top vertex of.\nThere are two things we
      need to calculate:\n$pChoose_{bridge}$ -- The probability of eventually choosing
      a certain bridge\nadjacent to $i$ (or the \"escape edge\" of $i$).\n$pChoose_C$
      -- The probability of eventually choosing one of two edges adjacent\nto $i$
      on a cycle\n$C \\in CC$.\nUsing these, we can compute $pEscape_i$ and $qVisit_{i,
      j}$ as follows:\n\n$qVisit_{i, j}$ on bridges $\\{i, j\\}$ (and $pEscape_i$,
      if there is an \"escape\nedge\") are equal to $pChoose_{bridge}$.\n\nWe are
      left with computing $qVisit_{i, j}$ for all $j$ on a cycle $C \\in CC$.\nAny
      corresponding path must eventually select one of two edges adjacent to $i$\non
      $C$, and traverse the path from $i$ to $j$ along that edge. The probability\nof
      this happening is the product of $pChoose_C$ and $pEscape_{u}$ for all $u$\nalong
      this path. So $qVisit_{i, j}$ can be computed in a similar way as in\nSubtask
      3.\n\nThe next few paragraphs describe how to compute $pChoose_{bridge}$ and\n$pChoose_C$
      for $C \\in CC$ fast.\nLet''s consider $pChoose_{bridge}$. Any corresponding
      path can be described as a\ntraversal of some subset of cycles $C_0, C_1, ...,
      C_{k-1}$, in this order, plus\nthe extra edge.\nSo $pChoose_{bridge}$ is the
      sum of the following over all ordered subsets\n$C_0, C_1, ..., C_{k-1}$:\n$$\n\\left(\\prod_{h=0}^{k-1}
      \\left(1 - p_i\\right) \\cdot \\frac{2}{d_i-2h} \\cdot qEscape_{C_h}\\right)
      \\cdot \\left(1 - p_i\\right) \\cdot \\frac{1}{d_i-2k}\n$$\nAlso, the above
      term doesn''t change if we permute $C_0, C_1, ..., C_{k-1}$, so\nlet''s instead
      sum over all subsets $S \\subseteq CC$:\n$$\npChoose_{bridge} = \\sum_{S \\subseteq
      CC} \\left(k! \\cdot \\left(1 - p_i\\right)^{k+1} \\cdot 2^k \\cdot \\left(\\prod_{h=0}^{k}
      \\frac{1}{d_i-2h}\\right) \\cdot \\prod_{C \\in S} qEscape_{C}\\right)\n$$\n$pChoose_C$
      for $C \\in CC$ can be calculated in the same way, except that in the\nabove
      formula we use $CC \\setminus \\{C\\}$ instead of $CC$.\nCalculating the above
      sums straightforwardly takes $O(2^K \\cdot K^2)$ time, and\nthis passes Subtask
      4 where $K \\le 5$.\nLet''s make it faster. Note that the terms with the same
      $k$ in the above formula\nhave a common factor, namely\n$w_k = k! \\cdot (1
      - p_i)^{k+1} \\cdot 2^k \\cdot (\\prod_{h=0}^{k} \\frac{1}{d_i-2h})$.\nFactoring
      this out, it suffices to compute the sum of\n$\\prod_{C \\in S} qEscape_{C}$
      for all subsets $S \\in CC$ of size $k$.\nWe can do this using generating functions.
      Consider the generating function\n$$\nF(x) = \\prod_{C \\in CC} \\left(1 + qEscape_C
      x\\right)\n$$\nOnce we get this generating function, we add $w_k \\cdot F(x)
      [x^k]$ for all $k$\nto get $pChoose_{bridge}$. We can calculate $pChoose_C$
      for $C \\in CC$\nsimilarly, except that we use $CC \\setminus \\{C\\}$ instead
      of $CC$.\nThe generating function has degree $K$, so multiplying $(1 + qEscape_C
      x)$ takes\n$O(K)$ time. Thus it takes $O(K^2)$ time to calculate $F(x)$, and
      doing this for\nall $O(K)$ probabilities takes $O(K^3)$.\nThe sum of $K$ is
      $O(N)$, so the sum of $K^3$ for the above solution is\n$O(N \\cdot K^2)$. This

      we need to compute $pChoose_{bridge}$ and $pChoose_C$ in\n$O(K^2)$ time.\nNotice
      that the generating function we calculate for $pChoose_C$ is almost the\nsame
      as the one for $pChoose_{bridge}$, but is missing a factor of\n$(1 + qEscape_C
      x)$. This factor can be removed in $O(K)$ time (To divide such a\npolynomial,
      we perform steps backward as when we multiply.)\nIn summary, we spend $O(K)$
      divisions and multiplications, $O(K)$ time for\ncomputing $O(K)$ probabilities
      from the generating function, so in total we\nspend $O(K^2)$ time to compute
      $pChoose_{bridge}$ and $pChoose_C$.\nSumming $K^2$ over all vertices $i$, we
      get a time of $O(N^2)$, which gets full\ncredit.\nA full solution by Rain:\n\n#include

      3: Luxury River Cruise [Josh Alman and Nathan Pinsker, 2013]\n\nFarmer John

      rivers with N ports (1 <= N <= 1,000) labeled 1..N, and Bessie \nstarts at port
      1. Each port has exactly two rivers leading out of it which \nlead directly
      to other ports, and rivers can only be sailed one way.\n\nAt each port, the
      tour guides choose either the \"left\" river or the \"right\" \nriver to sail
      down next, but they keep repeating the same choices over and \nover. More specifically,
      the tour guides have chosen a short sequence of M \ndirections (1 <= M <= 500),
      each either \"left\" or \"right\", and have\nrepeated it K times (1 <= K <=
      1,000,000,000). Bessie thinks she is going\nin circles -- help her figure out

      problem involves simulating movement through a network of ports based on a repeating
      sequence of left/right directions. The key aspects are:\n1. The network of ports
      is represented as a graph, where each port has a \"left\" and \"right\" outgoing
      edge to other ports. \n2. A sequence of M left/right directions is given, which
      is repeated K times.\n3. We need to determine the final port after following
      this repeated sequence starting from port 1.\n\nTo solve this, we can:\n1. Read
      in the port graph and store the left/right destinations for each port\n2. Simulate
      the movement:\n   - Maintain a current port\n   - For each direction in the
      sequence:\n     - If ''L'', move to the left port, else move to the right port\n   -
      Repeat the sequence K times in total\n3. Output the final port\n\nThe number
      of repetitions K can be very large (up to 1 billion), so we need to find a way
      to avoid simulating all K repetitions. \n\nOne optimization is to notice that
      if we ever visit the same port twice at the same point in the direction sequence,
      we have entered a cycle. We can fast-forward by calculating how many full cycles
      are left.\n\nSo an optimized approach would be:\n1. Simulate the first M * N
      steps, keeping track of the port and position in the sequence for each step\n2.
      If a cycle is detected (same port and sequence position seen before):\n   -
      Calculate remaining number of cycles\n   - Fast-forward to the same point in
      the last cycle\n3. Finish simulating any remaining steps\n4. Output the final
      port\n\nThe time complexity will be O(M * N) and space complexity O(M * N) to
      store the state at each step for cycle detection.\n</thinking>","type":"text"},{"id":"toolu_01TCbGzzL5B2sa5xFezRTVMJ","input":{"reasoning":"We

      fast-forward to near the end by skipping full cycles\n\nTime Complexity: O(M

      3: Luxury River Cruise [Josh Alman and Nathan Pinsker, 2013]\n\nFarmer John
      is taking Bessie and the cows on a cruise! They are sailing on a \nnetwork of
      rivers with N ports (1 <= N <= 1,000) labeled 1..N, and Bessie \nstarts at port
      1. Each port has exactly two rivers leading out of it which \nlead directly
      to other ports, and rivers can only be sailed one way.\n\nAt each port, the
      tour guides choose either the \"left\" river or the \"right\" \nriver to sail
      down next, but they keep repeating the same choices over and \nover. More specifically,
      the tour guides have chosen a short sequence of M \ndirections (1 <= M <= 500),
      each either \"left\" or \"right\", and have\nrepeated it K times (1 <= K <=
      1,000,000,000). Bessie thinks she is going\nin circles -- help her figure out

      problem involves simulating movement through a network of ports based on a repeating
      sequence of left/right directions. The key aspects are:\n1. The network of ports
      is represented as a graph, where each port has a \"left\" and \"right\" outgoing
      edge to other ports. \n2. A sequence of M left/right directions is given, which
      is repeated K times.\n3. We need to determine the final port after following
      this repeated sequence starting from port 1.\n\nTo solve this, we can:\n1. Read
      in the port graph and store the left/right destinations for each port\n2. Simulate
      the movement:\n   - Maintain a current port\n   - For each direction in the
      sequence:\n     - If ''L'', move to the left port, else move to the right port\n   -
      Repeat the sequence K times in total\n3. Output the final port\n\nThe number
      of repetitions K can be very large (up to 1 billion), so we need to find a way
      to avoid simulating all K repetitions. \n\nOne optimization is to notice that
      if we ever visit the same port twice at the same point in the direction sequence,
      we have entered a cycle. We can fast-forward by calculating how many full cycles
      are left.\n\nSo an optimized approach would be:\n1. Simulate the first M * N
      steps, keeping track of the port and position in the sequence for each step\n2.
      If a cycle is detected (same port and sequence position seen before):\n   -
      Calculate remaining number of cycles\n   - Fast-forward to the same point in
      the last cycle\n3. Finish simulating any remaining steps\n4. Output the final
      port\n\nThe time complexity will be O(M * N) and space complexity O(M * N) to

      by Mythreya Dharani)\nLet''s start by defining a cow as covered if there is
      a patch feeding its\nbreed within a distance of $K$. The problem is asking us
      to cover all cows with\nthe minimum number of patches.\nConsider each cow $i$
      from $1 \\dots N$ in that order, placing patches whenever\nnecessary. First
      of all, if the current cow is already covered,  then we don''t\nneed to place
      another patch, and we can just move on. Otherwise, we need to\nplace a new patch
      for this cow, so where would we place it? Consider what\nhappens if we place
      the patch at position $i + K$. Not only will cow $i$ be\ncovered but any cows
      after it which are within $K$ distance of that patch will\nalso be covered.
      In fact, placing it at this location maximizes the number of\npotential cows
      that can be covered. \nThus, we can just implement this strategy starting at
      cow $1$. Keep in mind that\nif there is a cow $i$ which needs to be fed and
      $i + K > N$, we can just place\nour new patch at position $i$ since all remaining
      same-breed cows can feed off\nthat patch. This solution runs in $O(N)$ time
      since we are just doing a single\npass over the $N$ cows.\nThere is actually
      one edge case; what if when we try to place a patch at\nposition $i$ but there
      is already a patch there? In this case, we can place the\npatch at $i-1$ instead,
      as it may be proven that there can''t already be patches\nat both $i-1$ and
      $i$. As $i-1+K\\ge N$, this patch covers all cows from $i$ to\n$N$ of the same
      breed as cow $i$.\nMythreya Dharani''s C++ code:\n\n#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing

      by Rain Jiang, Benjamin Qi)\nRestating the problem:\nYou are given an undirected
      graph, such that each edge belongs to at most one\nsimple cycle. Such a graph
      is called a\ncactus.\nYou start walking at vertex $1$. Every time you are at
      any vertex $i$, do the\nfollowing:\nWith a probability of $p_i$, end the walk.Otherwise,
      if there are no untraversed edges adjacent to $i$, end the\nwalk.Otherwise,
      choose an untraversed edge adjacent to $i$ uniformly randomly,\nand traverse
      it.\nFor all vertices $i$, you want to find the probability that you end your
      walk at\n$i$. Let''s call this probability $ans_i$.\nLet $d_i$ be $\\deg(i)$
      if $i=1$, and $\\deg(i)-1$ otherwise.\nLet $K$ be the maximum number of cycles
      that any vertex belongs to.\nSubtask 1: $N \\le 11$.\nFrom $N \\le 11$, we can
      see that\n$M \\le \\frac{3}{2} (N - 1) \\le \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot 10 = 15$.\nWith
      these bounds, an $O(2^M \\cdot M)$ DP is sufficient.\nLet $dp_{i, E}$ be the
      probability that you reach a state where you''re at vertex\n$i$, and the set
      of untraversed edges is $E$.\nLet''s see how to transition from $dp_{i, E}$
      to other states.\nLet $E''$ be the set of edges in $E$ adjacent to $i$.\nIf
      $E''$ is empty, we add $dp_{i, E}$ to $ans_i$.\nOtherwise, we add $dp_{i, E}
      \\cdot p_i$ to $ans_i$. Also, for each edge\n$e = \\{i, j\\} \\in E''$ adjacent
      to $i$, we add\n$dp_{i, E} \\cdot (1 - p_i) \\cdot \\frac{1}{|E''|}$ to\n$dp_{j,
      E \\setminus \\{e\\}}$,\nBecause the time spent on transitions from any $dp_{i,
      E}$ is $O(\\deg(i))$, and\nthe sum of $\\deg(i)$ is $O(M)$, the total time taken

      all\nof Bessie''s possible walks. The number of walks is bounded above by\n$N\\cdot
      3^{(\\#\\text{ simple cycles})}\\cdot \\prod_{1\\le i\\le N}(\\#\\text{ simple
      cycles adjacent to }i)!$\nbecause if we:\nFix Bessie''s ending vertex (choices:
      $N$)For each simple cycle, decide which direction to traverse it in, or not\ntraverse
      it at all (choices: $3^{(\\#\\text{ simple cycles})}$)For each vertex, decide
      in what order we will traverse the simple cycles\nadjacent to it (choices:\n$\\prod_{1\\le
      i\\le N}(\\#\\text{ simple cycles adjacent to }i)!$).\nthen Bessie''s walk is
      uniquely determined. For $N\\le 11$, the number of simple\ncycles is at most  $(N-1)/2\\le
      5$, so the total number of walks cannot be very\nlarge.\nSubtask 3: $K \\le
      1$.\nThe graph is a vertex-disjoint cactus. We need to modify the algorithm
      from\nSubtask 2 to handle cycles.\nAgain, root the cactus at vertex $1$, and
      consider the\nDFS tree of this cactus. Since we\ndid DFS, each cycle can be
      represented as path from a vertex to one of its\ndescendants, plus the corresponding
      back edge. Let''s call this highest vertex\nthe top vertex of the cycle.\nYou
      can see that the path generally moves downward, with occasional roundabouts\nalong
      cycles.\nSimilar to Subtask 2, let $pVisit_i$ be the probability that you reach
      vertex\n$i$ from the root.\nThe transitions using a non-cycle edge can be handled
      similar to Subtask 2.\nLet''s see how to transition using cycle edges. Let $i$
      be the top vertex of\ncycle $C$.\nWe describe how to transition from $i$ to
      another vertex $j$ on cycle $C$. We\ncan see that $pVisit_j$ is the sum of the
      two probabilities of going from $i$ to\n$j$, by choosing one of two paths going
      from $i$ to $j$ along $C$. The\nprobability of traversing one such path is the
      product of $pVisit_i$ and\n$(1 - p_u) \\cdot \\frac{1}{d_u}$ for all vertices
      $u$ along that path.\nYou should also handle the special case of traversing
      the whole cycle $C$ and\nvisiting $i$ a second time. The probability of this
      occurring is similar to the\nabove. After we traverse $C$, there are no more
      cycle edges adjacent to $i$, so\nwe are forced to either stop at $i$ or traverse
      an adjacent non-cycle edge.\nWe can do this using a DFS from vertex $1$. We
      process each cycle $C$ by going\nthrough it twice, once in each direction, taking
      $O(|C|)$ time.\nTime complexity: $O(M)$.\nRain''s code:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include

      5, 6\nAs in earlier subtasks, root the cactus at vertex $1$ and consider the
      DFS tree\nof it.\nHowever, the path is more complex: it can go down the tree
      for quite a while,\nbut eventually retrace and traverse another path.\nLet''s
      define a few terms. Fix vertex $i$. Consider the edge $f$ from $i$ to its\nparent.
      By the assumption that the graph is a cactus, $f$ must either be a\nbridge or
      is\ncontained in a (unique) cycle $C$. (From now on, when we say \"bridge\",
      we mean\nit in the graph theory sense.) If $f$ is a bridge, then call $pb_i=f$
      the\nparent bridge of $i$. Otherwise, call $pc_i=C$ the parent cycle of\n$i$.\nIn
      any case, let the predecessor of vertex $i$ be either its parent (if\n$f$ is
      a bridge) or the top vertex of $pc_i$ (if $f$ isn''t a bridge.)\nSymmetrically,
      $i$ is a successor of its predecessor.\nAlso, let the subcactus of $i$ be the
      connected subgraph containing $i$\nobtained by deleting $pb_i$ or all edges
      of $pc_i$. Let $T_i$ be the subcactus\nof $i$.\nLet''s observe what edges adjacent
      to vertex $i$ are untraversed when we visit\n$i$ for the first time. Consider
      two cases (recall that $f$ is the edge from $i$\nto its parent):\n\n$f$ is a
      bridge. If $i \\neq 1$, the only way to visit $i$ is through\n$pb_i$. We cannot
      use $pb_i$ twice, so we must stay in $T_i$ from now on.\n\n$f$ is not a bridge.
      We must enter $i$ via one of two adjacent edges in\n$pc_i$. In either case,
      all untraversed edges from $i$ are in $T_i$, except the\nother cycle edge. Indeed,
      this edge is the only edge that can be used to escape\n$T_i$, and once we use
      it, we can never go back to any vertex in $T_i$. We refer\nto this edge as the
      \"escape edge\" of $i$.\n\nThis motivates us to compute the following two DPs:\n$pEscape_i$
      -- the probability that, starting from $i$, we eventually use the\n\"escape
      edge\" from $i$ (For convenience later, let $pEscape_i = 0$ if there is\nno
      such \"escape edge\".)\n$qVisit_{i, j}$ -- the probability that, starting from
      $i$, we visit one of its\nsuccessors $j$.\nIf we have these two DPs, we can
      compute the answer using a DFS from vertex $1$\nas follows.\nSuppose the DFS
      reaches $i$. Let $pVisit_i$ be defined similar to Subtasks 2 and\n3.\nFor a
      successor $j$ of $i$, set $pVisit_j = pVisit_i \\cdot qVisit_{i, j}$, and\nrecurse
      on $j$.\nFinally, let''s compute $ans_i$. You end up at vertex $i$ if you visit
      vertex\n$i$, and you don''t do either of the following:\n\nUse the \"escape
      edge\" from $i$.\n\nEventually reach a successor $j$, and never escape from
      its subcactus.\n\nSince all bad cases above are mutually exclusive, we have\n$$\nans_i
      = pVisit_i \\cdot \\left(1 - pEscape_i - \\sum_{j\\:\\textrm{is a successor
      of}\\:i} qVisit_{i, j} \\left(1 - pEscape_j\\right)\\right)\n$$\nSince each
      vertex has a unique predecessor, the time to compute $ans_i$ from\n$pEscape$
      and $qVisit$ is $O(M)$.\nLet''s compute $pEscape$ and $qVisit$ in a bottom-up
      fashion. Suppose we want to\ncompute them for $i$.\nLet $qEscape_C$ for a cycle
      $C$ with top vertex $i$ be equal to the product of\n$pEscape_j$ for all vertices
      $j \\in C$ excluding $i$. In other words, this is\nthe probability that you
      can complete one traversal of $C$ from $i$ and end up\nback at $i$. \nLet $CC$
      be the set of cycles that $i$ is the top vertex of.\nThere are two things we
      need to calculate:\n$pChoose_{bridge}$ -- The probability of eventually choosing
      a certain bridge\nadjacent to $i$ (or the \"escape edge\" of $i$).\n$pChoose_C$
      -- The probability of eventually choosing one of two edges adjacent\nto $i$
      on a cycle\n$C \\in CC$.\nUsing these, we can compute $pEscape_i$ and $qVisit_{i,
      j}$ as follows:\n\n$qVisit_{i, j}$ on bridges $\\{i, j\\}$ (and $pEscape_i$,
      if there is an \"escape\nedge\") are equal to $pChoose_{bridge}$.\n\nWe are
      left with computing $qVisit_{i, j}$ for all $j$ on a cycle $C \\in CC$.\nAny
      corresponding path must eventually select one of two edges adjacent to $i$\non
      $C$, and traverse the path from $i$ to $j$ along that edge. The probability\nof
      this happening is the product of $pChoose_C$ and $pEscape_{u}$ for all $u$\nalong
      this path. So $qVisit_{i, j}$ can be computed in a similar way as in\nSubtask
      3.\n\nThe next few paragraphs describe how to compute $pChoose_{bridge}$ and\n$pChoose_C$
      for $C \\in CC$ fast.\nLet''s consider $pChoose_{bridge}$. Any corresponding
      path can be described as a\ntraversal of some subset of cycles $C_0, C_1, ...,
      C_{k-1}$, in this order, plus\nthe extra edge.\nSo $pChoose_{bridge}$ is the
      sum of the following over all ordered subsets\n$C_0, C_1, ..., C_{k-1}$:\n$$\n\\left(\\prod_{h=0}^{k-1}
      \\left(1 - p_i\\right) \\cdot \\frac{2}{d_i-2h} \\cdot qEscape_{C_h}\\right)
      \\cdot \\left(1 - p_i\\right) \\cdot \\frac{1}{d_i-2k}\n$$\nAlso, the above
      term doesn''t change if we permute $C_0, C_1, ..., C_{k-1}$, so\nlet''s instead
      sum over all subsets $S \\subseteq CC$:\n$$\npChoose_{bridge} = \\sum_{S \\subseteq
      CC} \\left(k! \\cdot \\left(1 - p_i\\right)^{k+1} \\cdot 2^k \\cdot \\left(\\prod_{h=0}^{k}
      \\frac{1}{d_i-2h}\\right) \\cdot \\prod_{C \\in S} qEscape_{C}\\right)\n$$\n$pChoose_C$
      for $C \\in CC$ can be calculated in the same way, except that in the\nabove
      formula we use $CC \\setminus \\{C\\}$ instead of $CC$.\nCalculating the above
      sums straightforwardly takes $O(2^K \\cdot K^2)$ time, and\nthis passes Subtask
      4 where $K \\le 5$.\nLet''s make it faster. Note that the terms with the same
      $k$ in the above formula\nhave a common factor, namely\n$w_k = k! \\cdot (1
      - p_i)^{k+1} \\cdot 2^k \\cdot (\\prod_{h=0}^{k} \\frac{1}{d_i-2h})$.\nFactoring
      this out, it suffices to compute the sum of\n$\\prod_{C \\in S} qEscape_{C}$
      for all subsets $S \\in CC$ of size $k$.\nWe can do this using generating functions.
      Consider the generating function\n$$\nF(x) = \\prod_{C \\in CC} \\left(1 + qEscape_C
      x\\right)\n$$\nOnce we get this generating function, we add $w_k \\cdot F(x)
      [x^k]$ for all $k$\nto get $pChoose_{bridge}$. We can calculate $pChoose_C$
      for $C \\in CC$\nsimilarly, except that we use $CC \\setminus \\{C\\}$ instead
      of $CC$.\nThe generating function has degree $K$, so multiplying $(1 + qEscape_C
      x)$ takes\n$O(K)$ time. Thus it takes $O(K^2)$ time to calculate $F(x)$, and
      doing this for\nall $O(K)$ probabilities takes $O(K^3)$.\nThe sum of $K$ is
      $O(N)$, so the sum of $K^3$ for the above solution is\n$O(N \\cdot K^2)$. This
      is enough to pass subtask 5, where $K \\le 50$.\nRain''s code for Subtask 5:\n\n#include

      we need to compute $pChoose_{bridge}$ and $pChoose_C$ in\n$O(K^2)$ time.\nNotice
      that the generating function we calculate for $pChoose_C$ is almost the\nsame
      as the one for $pChoose_{bridge}$, but is missing a factor of\n$(1 + qEscape_C
      x)$. This factor can be removed in $O(K)$ time (To divide such a\npolynomial,
      we perform steps backward as when we multiply.)\nIn summary, we spend $O(K)$
      divisions and multiplications, $O(K)$ time for\ncomputing $O(K)$ probabilities
      from the generating function, so in total we\nspend $O(K^2)$ time to compute
      $pChoose_{bridge}$ and $pChoose_C$.\nSumming $K^2$ over all vertices $i$, we
      get a time of $O(N^2)$, which gets full\ncredit.\nA full solution by Rain:\n\n#include

      \\le {N} \\le {10^5}$) cows, the breed of each being\neither a Guernsey or a
      Holstein. They have lined up horizontally with the cows occupying positions
      \nlabeled from\n$1\\dots N$.\n\nSince all the cows are hungry, FJ decides to
      plant grassy patches on some\nof the positions $1\\dots N$. Guernseys and Holsteins
      prefer different types of\ngrass, so if Farmer John decides to plant grass at
      some location, he must choose\nto planting either Guernsey-preferred grass or
      Holstein-preferred grass --- he\ncannot plant both at the same location. Each
      patch of grass planted can feed an\nunlimited number of cows of the appropriate
      breed. \n\nEach cow is willing to move a maximum of $K$ ($0 \\le {K} \\le N-1$)
      positions to\nreach a patch. Find the minimum number of patches needed to feed

      containing $N$ and $K$. The next line will\ncontain a string of length $N$,
      where each character denotes the breed of the\n$i$th cow (G meaning Guernsey
      and H meaning Holstein).\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):\nFor

      all the cows with the minimum number of patches. The $i$th character,\ndescribing
      the $i$th position, should be a ''.'' if there is no patch, a ''G'' if\nthere

      that for some test cases, there are multiple acceptable configurations that\nmanage
      to feed all cows while using the minimum number of patches. For example,\nin
      the fourth test case, another acceptable answer would be:\n\n\n.GH..\n\nThis
      corresponds to placing a patch feeding Guernseys on the 2nd position and a\npatch
      feeding Holsteins on the third position. This uses the optimal number of\npatches
      and ensures that all cows are within 3 positions of a patch they prefer.\n\n\n\nSCORING:\nInputs
      2 through 4 have $N \\le 10$. Inputs 5 through 8 have $N \\le 40$. Inputs 9

      by Mythreya Dharani)\nLet''s start by defining a cow as covered if there is
      a patch feeding its\nbreed within a distance of $K$. The problem is asking us
      to cover all cows with\nthe minimum number of patches.\nConsider each cow $i$
      from $1 \\dots N$ in that order, placing patches whenever\nnecessary. First
      of all, if the current cow is already covered,  then we don''t\nneed to place
      another patch, and we can just move on. Otherwise, we need to\nplace a new patch
      for this cow, so where would we place it? Consider what\nhappens if we place
      the patch at position $i + K$. Not only will cow $i$ be\ncovered but any cows
      after it which are within $K$ distance of that patch will\nalso be covered.
      In fact, placing it at this location maximizes the number of\npotential cows
      that can be covered. \nThus, we can just implement this strategy starting at
      cow $1$. Keep in mind that\nif there is a cow $i$ which needs to be fed and
      $i + K > N$, we can just place\nour new patch at position $i$ since all remaining
      same-breed cows can feed off\nthat patch. This solution runs in $O(N)$ time
      since we are just doing a single\npass over the $N$ cows.\nThere is actually
      one edge case; what if when we try to place a patch at\nposition $i$ but there
      is already a patch there? In this case, we can place the\npatch at $i-1$ instead,
      as it may be proven that there can''t already be patches\nat both $i-1$ and
      $i$. As $i-1+K\\ge N$, this patch covers all cows from $i$ to\n$N$ of the same
      breed as cow $i$.\nMythreya Dharani''s C++ code:\n\n#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing

      of islands, and no bridge connects an island to itself).\n\nIt is also guaranteed
      that no bridge lies on more than one simple cycle. A\nsimple cycle is a cycle

      travels according to the following procedure.\nSupposing she is currently at
      island $i$,\n\nIf there are no bridges adjacent to island $i$ that she has not

      by Rain Jiang, Benjamin Qi)\nRestating the problem:\nYou are given an undirected
      graph, such that each edge belongs to at most one\nsimple cycle. Such a graph
      is called a\ncactus.\nYou start walking at vertex $1$. Every time you are at
      any vertex $i$, do the\nfollowing:\nWith a probability of $p_i$, end the walk.Otherwise,
      if there are no untraversed edges adjacent to $i$, end the\nwalk.Otherwise,
      choose an untraversed edge adjacent to $i$ uniformly randomly,\nand traverse
      it.\nFor all vertices $i$, you want to find the probability that you end your
      walk at\n$i$. Let''s call this probability $ans_i$.\nLet $d_i$ be $\\deg(i)$
      if $i=1$, and $\\deg(i)-1$ otherwise.\nLet $K$ be the maximum number of cycles
      that any vertex belongs to.\nSubtask 1: $N \\le 11$.\nFrom $N \\le 11$, we can
      see that\n$M \\le \\frac{3}{2} (N - 1) \\le \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot 10 = 15$.\nWith
      these bounds, an $O(2^M \\cdot M)$ DP is sufficient.\nLet $dp_{i, E}$ be the
      probability that you reach a state where you''re at vertex\n$i$, and the set
      of untraversed edges is $E$.\nLet''s see how to transition from $dp_{i, E}$
      to other states.\nLet $E''$ be the set of edges in $E$ adjacent to $i$.\nIf
      $E''$ is empty, we add $dp_{i, E}$ to $ans_i$.\nOtherwise, we add $dp_{i, E}
      \\cdot p_i$ to $ans_i$. Also, for each edge\n$e = \\{i, j\\} \\in E''$ adjacent
      to $i$, we add\n$dp_{i, E} \\cdot (1 - p_i) \\cdot \\frac{1}{|E''|}$ to\n$dp_{j,
      E \\setminus \\{e\\}}$,\nBecause the time spent on transitions from any $dp_{i,
      E}$ is $O(\\deg(i))$, and\nthe sum of $\\deg(i)$ is $O(M)$, the total time taken
      for this DP is\n$O(2^M \\cdot M)$.\nRain''s code:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include

      all\nof Bessie''s possible walks. The number of walks is bounded above by\n$N\\cdot
      3^{(\\#\\text{ simple cycles})}\\cdot \\prod_{1\\le i\\le N}(\\#\\text{ simple
      cycles adjacent to }i)!$\nbecause if we:\nFix Bessie''s ending vertex (choices:
      $N$)For each simple cycle, decide which direction to traverse it in, or not\ntraverse
      it at all (choices: $3^{(\\#\\text{ simple cycles})}$)For each vertex, decide
      in what order we will traverse the simple cycles\nadjacent to it (choices:\n$\\prod_{1\\le
      i\\le N}(\\#\\text{ simple cycles adjacent to }i)!$).\nthen Bessie''s walk is
      uniquely determined. For $N\\le 11$, the number of simple\ncycles is at most  $(N-1)/2\\le
      5$, so the total number of walks cannot be very\nlarge.\nSubtask 3: $K \\le
      1$.\nThe graph is a vertex-disjoint cactus. We need to modify the algorithm
      from\nSubtask 2 to handle cycles.\nAgain, root the cactus at vertex $1$, and
      consider the\nDFS tree of this cactus. Since we\ndid DFS, each cycle can be
      represented as path from a vertex to one of its\ndescendants, plus the corresponding
      back edge. Let''s call this highest vertex\nthe top vertex of the cycle.\nYou
      can see that the path generally moves downward, with occasional roundabouts\nalong
      cycles.\nSimilar to Subtask 2, let $pVisit_i$ be the probability that you reach
      vertex\n$i$ from the root.\nThe transitions using a non-cycle edge can be handled
      similar to Subtask 2.\nLet''s see how to transition using cycle edges. Let $i$
      be the top vertex of\ncycle $C$.\nWe describe how to transition from $i$ to
      another vertex $j$ on cycle $C$. We\ncan see that $pVisit_j$ is the sum of the
      two probabilities of going from $i$ to\n$j$, by choosing one of two paths going
      from $i$ to $j$ along $C$. The\nprobability of traversing one such path is the
      product of $pVisit_i$ and\n$(1 - p_u) \\cdot \\frac{1}{d_u}$ for all vertices
      $u$ along that path.\nYou should also handle the special case of traversing
      the whole cycle $C$ and\nvisiting $i$ a second time. The probability of this
      occurring is similar to the\nabove. After we traverse $C$, there are no more
      cycle edges adjacent to $i$, so\nwe are forced to either stop at $i$ or traverse
      an adjacent non-cycle edge.\nWe can do this using a DFS from vertex $1$. We
      process each cycle $C$ by going\nthrough it twice, once in each direction, taking
      $O(|C|)$ time.\nTime complexity: $O(M)$.\nRain''s code:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include

      5, 6\nAs in earlier subtasks, root the cactus at vertex $1$ and consider the
      DFS tree\nof it.\nHowever, the path is more complex: it can go down the tree
      for quite a while,\nbut eventually retrace and traverse another path.\nLet''s
      define a few terms. Fix vertex $i$. Consider the edge $f$ from $i$ to its\nparent.
      By the assumption that the graph is a cactus, $f$ must either be a\nbridge or
      is\ncontained in a (unique) cycle $C$. (From now on, when we say \"bridge\",
      we mean\nit in the graph theory sense.) If $f$ is a bridge, then call $pb_i=f$
      the\nparent bridge of $i$. Otherwise, call $pc_i=C$ the parent cycle of\n$i$.\nIn
      any case, let the predecessor of vertex $i$ be either its parent (if\n$f$ is
      a bridge) or the top vertex of $pc_i$ (if $f$ isn''t a bridge.)\nSymmetrically,
      $i$ is a successor of its predecessor.\nAlso, let the subcactus of $i$ be the
      connected subgraph containing $i$\nobtained by deleting $pb_i$ or all edges
      of $pc_i$. Let $T_i$ be the subcactus\nof $i$.\nLet''s observe what edges adjacent
      to vertex $i$ are untraversed when we visit\n$i$ for the first time. Consider
      two cases (recall that $f$ is the edge from $i$\nto its parent):\n\n$f$ is a
      bridge. If $i \\neq 1$, the only way to visit $i$ is through\n$pb_i$. We cannot
      use $pb_i$ twice, so we must stay in $T_i$ from now on.\n\n$f$ is not a bridge.
      We must enter $i$ via one of two adjacent edges in\n$pc_i$. In either case,
      all untraversed edges from $i$ are in $T_i$, except the\nother cycle edge. Indeed,
      this edge is the only edge that can be used to escape\n$T_i$, and once we use
      it, we can never go back to any vertex in $T_i$. We refer\nto this edge as the
      \"escape edge\" of $i$.\n\nThis motivates us to compute the following two DPs:\n$pEscape_i$
      -- the probability that, starting from $i$, we eventually use the\n\"escape
      edge\" from $i$ (For convenience later, let $pEscape_i = 0$ if there is\nno
      such \"escape edge\".)\n$qVisit_{i, j}$ -- the probability that, starting from
      $i$, we visit one of its\nsuccessors $j$.\nIf we have these two DPs, we can
      compute the answer using a DFS from vertex $1$\nas follows.\nSuppose the DFS
      reaches $i$. Let $pVisit_i$ be defined similar to Subtasks 2 and\n3.\nFor a
      successor $j$ of $i$, set $pVisit_j = pVisit_i \\cdot qVisit_{i, j}$, and\nrecurse
      on $j$.\nFinally, let''s compute $ans_i$. You end up at vertex $i$ if you visit
      vertex\n$i$, and you don''t do either of the following:\n\nUse the \"escape
      edge\" from $i$.\n\nEventually reach a successor $j$, and never escape from
      its subcactus.\n\nSince all bad cases above are mutually exclusive, we have\n$$\nans_i
      = pVisit_i \\cdot \\left(1 - pEscape_i - \\sum_{j\\:\\textrm{is a successor
      of}\\:i} qVisit_{i, j} \\left(1 - pEscape_j\\right)\\right)\n$$\nSince each
      vertex has a unique predecessor, the time to compute $ans_i$ from\n$pEscape$
      and $qVisit$ is $O(M)$.\nLet''s compute $pEscape$ and $qVisit$ in a bottom-up
      fashion. Suppose we want to\ncompute them for $i$.\nLet $qEscape_C$ for a cycle
      $C$ with top vertex $i$ be equal to the product of\n$pEscape_j$ for all vertices
      $j \\in C$ excluding $i$. In other words, this is\nthe probability that you
      can complete one traversal of $C$ from $i$ and end up\nback at $i$. \nLet $CC$
      be the set of cycles that $i$ is the top vertex of.\nThere are two things we
      need to calculate:\n$pChoose_{bridge}$ -- The probability of eventually choosing
      a certain bridge\nadjacent to $i$ (or the \"escape edge\" of $i$).\n$pChoose_C$
      -- The probability of eventually choosing one of two edges adjacent\nto $i$
      on a cycle\n$C \\in CC$.\nUsing these, we can compute $pEscape_i$ and $qVisit_{i,
      j}$ as follows:\n\n$qVisit_{i, j}$ on bridges $\\{i, j\\}$ (and $pEscape_i$,
      if there is an \"escape\nedge\") are equal to $pChoose_{bridge}$.\n\nWe are
      left with computing $qVisit_{i, j}$ for all $j$ on a cycle $C \\in CC$.\nAny
      corresponding path must eventually select one of two edges adjacent to $i$\non
      $C$, and traverse the path from $i$ to $j$ along that edge. The probability\nof
      this happening is the product of $pChoose_C$ and $pEscape_{u}$ for all $u$\nalong
      this path. So $qVisit_{i, j}$ can be computed in a similar way as in\nSubtask
      3.\n\nThe next few paragraphs describe how to compute $pChoose_{bridge}$ and\n$pChoose_C$
      for $C \\in CC$ fast.\nLet''s consider $pChoose_{bridge}$. Any corresponding
      path can be described as a\ntraversal of some subset of cycles $C_0, C_1, ...,
      C_{k-1}$, in this order, plus\nthe extra edge.\nSo $pChoose_{bridge}$ is the
      sum of the following over all ordered subsets\n$C_0, C_1, ..., C_{k-1}$:\n$$\n\\left(\\prod_{h=0}^{k-1}
      \\left(1 - p_i\\right) \\cdot \\frac{2}{d_i-2h} \\cdot qEscape_{C_h}\\right)
      \\cdot \\left(1 - p_i\\right) \\cdot \\frac{1}{d_i-2k}\n$$\nAlso, the above
      term doesn''t change if we permute $C_0, C_1, ..., C_{k-1}$, so\nlet''s instead
      sum over all subsets $S \\subseteq CC$:\n$$\npChoose_{bridge} = \\sum_{S \\subseteq
      CC} \\left(k! \\cdot \\left(1 - p_i\\right)^{k+1} \\cdot 2^k \\cdot \\left(\\prod_{h=0}^{k}
      \\frac{1}{d_i-2h}\\right) \\cdot \\prod_{C \\in S} qEscape_{C}\\right)\n$$\n$pChoose_C$
      for $C \\in CC$ can be calculated in the same way, except that in the\nabove
      formula we use $CC \\setminus \\{C\\}$ instead of $CC$.\nCalculating the above
      sums straightforwardly takes $O(2^K \\cdot K^2)$ time, and\nthis passes Subtask
      4 where $K \\le 5$.\nLet''s make it faster. Note that the terms with the same
      $k$ in the above formula\nhave a common factor, namely\n$w_k = k! \\cdot (1
      - p_i)^{k+1} \\cdot 2^k \\cdot (\\prod_{h=0}^{k} \\frac{1}{d_i-2h})$.\nFactoring
      this out, it suffices to compute the sum of\n$\\prod_{C \\in S} qEscape_{C}$
      for all subsets $S \\in CC$ of size $k$.\nWe can do this using generating functions.
      Consider the generating function\n$$\nF(x) = \\prod_{C \\in CC} \\left(1 + qEscape_C
      x\\right)\n$$\nOnce we get this generating function, we add $w_k \\cdot F(x)
      [x^k]$ for all $k$\nto get $pChoose_{bridge}$. We can calculate $pChoose_C$
      for $C \\in CC$\nsimilarly, except that we use $CC \\setminus \\{C\\}$ instead
      of $CC$.\nThe generating function has degree $K$, so multiplying $(1 + qEscape_C
      x)$ takes\n$O(K)$ time. Thus it takes $O(K^2)$ time to calculate $F(x)$, and
      doing this for\nall $O(K)$ probabilities takes $O(K^3)$.\nThe sum of $K$ is
      $O(N)$, so the sum of $K^3$ for the above solution is\n$O(N \\cdot K^2)$. This
      is enough to pass subtask 5, where $K \\le 50$.\nRain''s code for Subtask 5:\n\n#include

      we need to compute $pChoose_{bridge}$ and $pChoose_C$ in\n$O(K^2)$ time.\nNotice
      that the generating function we calculate for $pChoose_C$ is almost the\nsame
      as the one for $pChoose_{bridge}$, but is missing a factor of\n$(1 + qEscape_C
      x)$. This factor can be removed in $O(K)$ time (To divide such a\npolynomial,
      we perform steps backward as when we multiply.)\nIn summary, we spend $O(K)$
      divisions and multiplications, $O(K)$ time for\ncomputing $O(K)$ probabilities
      from the generating function, so in total we\nspend $O(K^2)$ time to compute
      $pChoose_{bridge}$ and $pChoose_C$.\nSumming $K^2$ over all vertices $i$, we
      get a time of $O(N^2)$, which gets full\ncredit.\nA full solution by Rain:\n\n#include

      3: Luxury River Cruise [Josh Alman and Nathan Pinsker, 2013]\n\nFarmer John
      is taking Bessie and the cows on a cruise! They are sailing on a \nnetwork of
      rivers with N ports (1 <= N <= 1,000) labeled 1..N, and Bessie \nstarts at port
      1. Each port has exactly two rivers leading out of it which \nlead directly
      to other ports, and rivers can only be sailed one way.\n\nAt each port, the
      tour guides choose either the \"left\" river or the \"right\" \nriver to sail
      down next, but they keep repeating the same choices over and \nover. More specifically,
      the tour guides have chosen a short sequence of M \ndirections (1 <= M <= 500),
      each either \"left\" or \"right\", and have\nrepeated it K times (1 <= K <=
      1,000,000,000). Bessie thinks she is going\nin circles -- help her figure out
      where she ends up!\n\nPROBLEM NAME: cruise\n\nINPUT FORMAT:\n\n* Line 1: Three

      of the sequence of directions, Bessie is at port\n2 (1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 2); after

      problem involves simulating movement through a network of ports based on a repeating
      sequence of left/right directions. The key aspects are:\n1. The network of ports
      is represented as a graph, where each port has a \"left\" and \"right\" outgoing
      edge to other ports. \n2. A sequence of M left/right directions is given, which
      is repeated K times.\n3. We need to determine the final port after following
      this repeated sequence starting from port 1.\n\nTo solve this, we can:\n1. Read
      in the port graph and store the left/right destinations for each port\n2. Simulate
      the movement:\n   - Maintain a current port\n   - For each direction in the
      sequence:\n     - If ''L'', move to the left port, else move to the right port\n   -
      Repeat the sequence K times in total\n3. Output the final port\n\nThe number
      of repetitions K can be very large (up to 1 billion), so we need to find a way
      to avoid simulating all K repetitions. \n\nOne optimization is to notice that
      if we ever visit the same port twice at the same point in the direction sequence,
      we have entered a cycle. We can fast-forward by calculating how many full cycles
      are left.\n\nSo an optimized approach would be:\n1. Simulate the first M * N
      steps, keeping track of the port and position in the sequence for each step\n2.
      If a cycle is detected (same port and sequence position seen before):\n   -
      Calculate remaining number of cycles\n   - Fast-forward to the same point in
      the last cycle\n3. Finish simulating any remaining steps\n4. Output the final
      port\n\nThe time complexity will be O(M * N) and space complexity O(M * N) to
      store the state at each step for cycle detection.\n</thinking>","type":"text"},{"id":"toolu_01TCbGzzL5B2sa5xFezRTVMJ","input":{"reasoning":"We

      3: Luxury River Cruise [Josh Alman and Nathan Pinsker, 2013]\n\nFarmer John
      is taking Bessie and the cows on a cruise! They are sailing on a \nnetwork of
      rivers with N ports (1 <= N <= 1,000) labeled 1..N, and Bessie \nstarts at port
      1. Each port has exactly two rivers leading out of it which \nlead directly
      to other ports, and rivers can only be sailed one way.\n\nAt each port, the
      tour guides choose either the \"left\" river or the \"right\" \nriver to sail
      down next, but they keep repeating the same choices over and \nover. More specifically,
      the tour guides have chosen a short sequence of M \ndirections (1 <= M <= 500),
      each either \"left\" or \"right\", and have\nrepeated it K times (1 <= K <=
      1,000,000,000). Bessie thinks she is going\nin circles -- help her figure out
      where she ends up!\n\nPROBLEM NAME: cruise\n\nINPUT FORMAT:\n\n* Line 1: Three
      space-separated integers N, M, and K.\n\n* Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 has two space-separated
      integers,\n        representing the number of the ports that port i''s left
      and\n        right rivers lead to, respectively.\n\n* Line N+2: M space-separated
      characters, either ''L'' or ''R''. ''L''\n        represents a choice of  ''left''

      previously solved the following problems in this competition:\n    <Examples>\n    <problem>\n    Farmer
      John has $N$ ($1 \\le {N} \\le {10^5}$) cows, the breed of each being\neither
      a Guernsey or a Holstein. They have lined up horizontally with the cows occupying
      positions \nlabeled from\n$1\\dots N$.\n\nSince all the cows are hungry, FJ
      decides to plant grassy patches on some\nof the positions $1\\dots N$. Guernseys
      and Holsteins prefer different types of\ngrass, so if Farmer John decides to
      plant grass at some location, he must choose\nto planting either Guernsey-preferred
      grass or Holstein-preferred grass --- he\ncannot plant both at the same location.
      Each patch of grass planted can feed an\nunlimited number of cows of the appropriate
      breed. \n\nEach cow is willing to move a maximum of $K$ ($0 \\le {K} \\le N-1$)
      positions to\nreach a patch. Find the minimum number of patches needed to feed
      all the cows.\nAlso, print a configuration of patches that uses the minimum
      amount of patches\nneeded to feed the cows. Any configuration that satisfies
      the above conditions\nwill be considered correct.\n\nINPUT FORMAT (input arrives

      an arrangement of cows. The\nfirst line of input contains $T$ ($1 \\le T \\le

      containing $N$ and $K$. The next line will\ncontain a string of length $N$,
      where each character denotes the breed of the\n$i$th cow (G meaning Guernsey
      and H meaning Holstein).\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):\nFor
      each of the $T$ test cases, please write two lines of output. For the first\nline,

      all the cows with the minimum number of patches. The $i$th character,\ndescribing
      the $i$th position, should be a ''.'' if there is no patch, a ''G'' if\nthere
      is a patch that feeds Guernseys, and a ''H'' if it feeds Holsteins. Any\nvalid

      corresponds to placing a patch feeding Guernseys on the 2nd position and a\npatch
      feeding Holsteins on the third position. This uses the optimal number of\npatches
      and ensures that all cows are within 3 positions of a patch they prefer.\n\n\n\nSCORING:\nInputs

      by Mythreya Dharani)\nLet''s start by defining a cow as covered if there is
      a patch feeding its\nbreed within a distance of $K$. The problem is asking us
      to cover all cows with\nthe minimum number of patches.\nConsider each cow $i$
      from $1 \\dots N$ in that order, placing patches whenever\nnecessary. First
      of all, if the current cow is already covered,  then we don''t\nneed to place
      another patch, and we can just move on. Otherwise, we need to\nplace a new patch
      for this cow, so where would we place it? Consider what\nhappens if we place
      the patch at position $i + K$. Not only will cow $i$ be\ncovered but any cows
      after it which are within $K$ distance of that patch will\nalso be covered.
      In fact, placing it at this location maximizes the number of\npotential cows
      that can be covered. \nThus, we can just implement this strategy starting at
      cow $1$. Keep in mind that\nif there is a cow $i$ which needs to be fed and
      $i + K > N$, we can just place\nour new patch at position $i$ since all remaining
      same-breed cows can feed off\nthat patch. This solution runs in $O(N)$ time
      since we are just doing a single\npass over the $N$ cows.\nThere is actually
      one edge case; what if when we try to place a patch at\nposition $i$ but there
      is already a patch there? In this case, we can place the\npatch at $i-1$ instead,
      as it may be proven that there can''t already be patches\nat both $i-1$ and
      $i$. As $i-1+K\\ge N$, this patch covers all cows from $i$ to\n$N$ of the same
      breed as cow $i$.\nMythreya Dharani''s C++ code:\n\n#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing

      by Rain Jiang, Benjamin Qi)\nRestating the problem:\nYou are given an undirected
      graph, such that each edge belongs to at most one\nsimple cycle. Such a graph
      is called a\ncactus.\nYou start walking at vertex $1$. Every time you are at
      any vertex $i$, do the\nfollowing:\nWith a probability of $p_i$, end the walk.Otherwise,
      if there are no untraversed edges adjacent to $i$, end the\nwalk.Otherwise,
      choose an untraversed edge adjacent to $i$ uniformly randomly,\nand traverse
      it.\nFor all vertices $i$, you want to find the probability that you end your
      walk at\n$i$. Let''s call this probability $ans_i$.\nLet $d_i$ be $\\deg(i)$
      if $i=1$, and $\\deg(i)-1$ otherwise.\nLet $K$ be the maximum number of cycles
      that any vertex belongs to.\nSubtask 1: $N \\le 11$.\nFrom $N \\le 11$, we can
      see that\n$M \\le \\frac{3}{2} (N - 1) \\le \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot 10 = 15$.\nWith
      these bounds, an $O(2^M \\cdot M)$ DP is sufficient.\nLet $dp_{i, E}$ be the
      probability that you reach a state where you''re at vertex\n$i$, and the set
      of untraversed edges is $E$.\nLet''s see how to transition from $dp_{i, E}$
      to other states.\nLet $E''$ be the set of edges in $E$ adjacent to $i$.\nIf
      $E''$ is empty, we add $dp_{i, E}$ to $ans_i$.\nOtherwise, we add $dp_{i, E}
      \\cdot p_i$ to $ans_i$. Also, for each edge\n$e = \\{i, j\\} \\in E''$ adjacent
      to $i$, we add\n$dp_{i, E} \\cdot (1 - p_i) \\cdot \\frac{1}{|E''|}$ to\n$dp_{j,
      E \\setminus \\{e\\}}$,\nBecause the time spent on transitions from any $dp_{i,
      E}$ is $O(\\deg(i))$, and\nthe sum of $\\deg(i)$ is $O(M)$, the total time taken
      for this DP is\n$O(2^M \\cdot M)$.\nRain''s code:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include

      all\nof Bessie''s possible walks. The number of walks is bounded above by\n$N\\cdot
      3^{(\\#\\text{ simple cycles})}\\cdot \\prod_{1\\le i\\le N}(\\#\\text{ simple
      cycles adjacent to }i)!$\nbecause if we:\nFix Bessie''s ending vertex (choices:
      $N$)For each simple cycle, decide which direction to traverse it in, or not\ntraverse
      it at all (choices: $3^{(\\#\\text{ simple cycles})}$)For each vertex, decide
      in what order we will traverse the simple cycles\nadjacent to it (choices:\n$\\prod_{1\\le
      i\\le N}(\\#\\text{ simple cycles adjacent to }i)!$).\nthen Bessie''s walk is
      uniquely determined. For $N\\le 11$, the number of simple\ncycles is at most  $(N-1)/2\\le
      5$, so the total number of walks cannot be very\nlarge.\nSubtask 3: $K \\le
      1$.\nThe graph is a vertex-disjoint cactus. We need to modify the algorithm
      from\nSubtask 2 to handle cycles.\nAgain, root the cactus at vertex $1$, and
      consider the\nDFS tree of this cactus. Since we\ndid DFS, each cycle can be
      represented as path from a vertex to one of its\ndescendants, plus the corresponding
      back edge. Let''s call this highest vertex\nthe top vertex of the cycle.\nYou
      can see that the path generally moves downward, with occasional roundabouts\nalong
      cycles.\nSimilar to Subtask 2, let $pVisit_i$ be the probability that you reach
      vertex\n$i$ from the root.\nThe transitions using a non-cycle edge can be handled
      similar to Subtask 2.\nLet''s see how to transition using cycle edges. Let $i$
      be the top vertex of\ncycle $C$.\nWe describe how to transition from $i$ to
      another vertex $j$ on cycle $C$. We\ncan see that $pVisit_j$ is the sum of the
      two probabilities of going from $i$ to\n$j$, by choosing one of two paths going
      from $i$ to $j$ along $C$. The\nprobability of traversing one such path is the
      product of $pVisit_i$ and\n$(1 - p_u) \\cdot \\frac{1}{d_u}$ for all vertices
      $u$ along that path.\nYou should also handle the special case of traversing
      the whole cycle $C$ and\nvisiting $i$ a second time. The probability of this
      occurring is similar to the\nabove. After we traverse $C$, there are no more
      cycle edges adjacent to $i$, so\nwe are forced to either stop at $i$ or traverse

      5, 6\nAs in earlier subtasks, root the cactus at vertex $1$ and consider the
      DFS tree\nof it.\nHowever, the path is more complex: it can go down the tree
      for quite a while,\nbut eventually retrace and traverse another path.\nLet''s
      define a few terms. Fix vertex $i$. Consider the edge $f$ from $i$ to its\nparent.
      By the assumption that the graph is a cactus, $f$ must either be a\nbridge or
      is\ncontained in a (unique) cycle $C$. (From now on, when we say \"bridge\",
      we mean\nit in the graph theory sense.) If $f$ is a bridge, then call $pb_i=f$
      the\nparent bridge of $i$. Otherwise, call $pc_i=C$ the parent cycle of\n$i$.\nIn
      any case, let the predecessor of vertex $i$ be either its parent (if\n$f$ is
      a bridge) or the top vertex of $pc_i$ (if $f$ isn''t a bridge.)\nSymmetrically,
      $i$ is a successor of its predecessor.\nAlso, let the subcactus of $i$ be the
      connected subgraph containing $i$\nobtained by deleting $pb_i$ or all edges
      of $pc_i$. Let $T_i$ be the subcactus\nof $i$.\nLet''s observe what edges adjacent
      to vertex $i$ are untraversed when we visit\n$i$ for the first time. Consider
      two cases (recall that $f$ is the edge from $i$\nto its parent):\n\n$f$ is a
      bridge. If $i \\neq 1$, the only way to visit $i$ is through\n$pb_i$. We cannot
      use $pb_i$ twice, so we must stay in $T_i$ from now on.\n\n$f$ is not a bridge.
      We must enter $i$ via one of two adjacent edges in\n$pc_i$. In either case,
      all untraversed edges from $i$ are in $T_i$, except the\nother cycle edge. Indeed,
      this edge is the only edge that can be used to escape\n$T_i$, and once we use
      it, we can never go back to any vertex in $T_i$. We refer\nto this edge as the
      \"escape edge\" of $i$.\n\nThis motivates us to compute the following two DPs:\n$pEscape_i$
      -- the probability that, starting from $i$, we eventually use the\n\"escape
      edge\" from $i$ (For convenience later, let $pEscape_i = 0$ if there is\nno
      such \"escape edge\".)\n$qVisit_{i, j}$ -- the probability that, starting from
      $i$, we visit one of its\nsuccessors $j$.\nIf we have these two DPs, we can
      compute the answer using a DFS from vertex $1$\nas follows.\nSuppose the DFS
      reaches $i$. Let $pVisit_i$ be defined similar to Subtasks 2 and\n3.\nFor a
      successor $j$ of $i$, set $pVisit_j = pVisit_i \\cdot qVisit_{i, j}$, and\nrecurse
      on $j$.\nFinally, let''s compute $ans_i$. You end up at vertex $i$ if you visit
      vertex\n$i$, and you don''t do either of the following:\n\nUse the \"escape
      edge\" from $i$.\n\nEventually reach a successor $j$, and never escape from
      its subcactus.\n\nSince all bad cases above are mutually exclusive, we have\n$$\nans_i
      = pVisit_i \\cdot \\left(1 - pEscape_i - \\sum_{j\\:\\textrm{is a successor
      of}\\:i} qVisit_{i, j} \\left(1 - pEscape_j\\right)\\right)\n$$\nSince each
      vertex has a unique predecessor, the time to compute $ans_i$ from\n$pEscape$
      and $qVisit$ is $O(M)$.\nLet''s compute $pEscape$ and $qVisit$ in a bottom-up
      fashion. Suppose we want to\ncompute them for $i$.\nLet $qEscape_C$ for a cycle
      $C$ with top vertex $i$ be equal to the product of\n$pEscape_j$ for all vertices
      $j \\in C$ excluding $i$. In other words, this is\nthe probability that you
      can complete one traversal of $C$ from $i$ and end up\nback at $i$. \nLet $CC$
      be the set of cycles that $i$ is the top vertex of.\nThere are two things we
      need to calculate:\n$pChoose_{bridge}$ -- The probability of eventually choosing
      a certain bridge\nadjacent to $i$ (or the \"escape edge\" of $i$).\n$pChoose_C$
      -- The probability of eventually choosing one of two edges adjacent\nto $i$
      on a cycle\n$C \\in CC$.\nUsing these, we can compute $pEscape_i$ and $qVisit_{i,
      j}$ as follows:\n\n$qVisit_{i, j}$ on bridges $\\{i, j\\}$ (and $pEscape_i$,
      if there is an \"escape\nedge\") are equal to $pChoose_{bridge}$.\n\nWe are
      left with computing $qVisit_{i, j}$ for all $j$ on a cycle $C \\in CC$.\nAny
      corresponding path must eventually select one of two edges adjacent to $i$\non
      $C$, and traverse the path from $i$ to $j$ along that edge. The probability\nof
      this happening is the product of $pChoose_C$ and $pEscape_{u}$ for all $u$\nalong
      this path. So $qVisit_{i, j}$ can be computed in a similar way as in\nSubtask
      3.\n\nThe next few paragraphs describe how to compute $pChoose_{bridge}$ and\n$pChoose_C$
      for $C \\in CC$ fast.\nLet''s consider $pChoose_{bridge}$. Any corresponding
      path can be described as a\ntraversal of some subset of cycles $C_0, C_1, ...,
      C_{k-1}$, in this order, plus\nthe extra edge.\nSo $pChoose_{bridge}$ is the
      sum of the following over all ordered subsets\n$C_0, C_1, ..., C_{k-1}$:\n$$\n\\left(\\prod_{h=0}^{k-1}
      \\left(1 - p_i\\right) \\cdot \\frac{2}{d_i-2h} \\cdot qEscape_{C_h}\\right)
      \\cdot \\left(1 - p_i\\right) \\cdot \\frac{1}{d_i-2k}\n$$\nAlso, the above
      term doesn''t change if we permute $C_0, C_1, ..., C_{k-1}$, so\nlet''s instead
      sum over all subsets $S \\subseteq CC$:\n$$\npChoose_{bridge} = \\sum_{S \\subseteq
      CC} \\left(k! \\cdot \\left(1 - p_i\\right)^{k+1} \\cdot 2^k \\cdot \\left(\\prod_{h=0}^{k}
      \\frac{1}{d_i-2h}\\right) \\cdot \\prod_{C \\in S} qEscape_{C}\\right)\n$$\n$pChoose_C$
      for $C \\in CC$ can be calculated in the same way, except that in the\nabove
      formula we use $CC \\setminus \\{C\\}$ instead of $CC$.\nCalculating the above
      sums straightforwardly takes $O(2^K \\cdot K^2)$ time, and\nthis passes Subtask
      4 where $K \\le 5$.\nLet''s make it faster. Note that the terms with the same
      $k$ in the above formula\nhave a common factor, namely\n$w_k = k! \\cdot (1
      - p_i)^{k+1} \\cdot 2^k \\cdot (\\prod_{h=0}^{k} \\frac{1}{d_i-2h})$.\nFactoring
      this out, it suffices to compute the sum of\n$\\prod_{C \\in S} qEscape_{C}$
      for all subsets $S \\in CC$ of size $k$.\nWe can do this using generating functions.
      Consider the generating function\n$$\nF(x) = \\prod_{C \\in CC} \\left(1 + qEscape_C
      x\\right)\n$$\nOnce we get this generating function, we add $w_k \\cdot F(x)
      [x^k]$ for all $k$\nto get $pChoose_{bridge}$. We can calculate $pChoose_C$
      for $C \\in CC$\nsimilarly, except that we use $CC \\setminus \\{C\\}$ instead
      of $CC$.\nThe generating function has degree $K$, so multiplying $(1 + qEscape_C
      x)$ takes\n$O(K)$ time. Thus it takes $O(K^2)$ time to calculate $F(x)$, and
      doing this for\nall $O(K)$ probabilities takes $O(K^3)$.\nThe sum of $K$ is
      $O(N)$, so the sum of $K^3$ for the above solution is\n$O(N \\cdot K^2)$. This
      is enough to pass subtask 5, where $K \\le 50$.\nRain''s code for Subtask 5:\n\n#include

      x)$. This factor can be removed in $O(K)$ time (To divide such a\npolynomial,
      we perform steps backward as when we multiply.)\nIn summary, we spend $O(K)$
      divisions and multiplications, $O(K)$ time for\ncomputing $O(K)$ probabilities
      from the generating function, so in total we\nspend $O(K^2)$ time to compute
      $pChoose_{bridge}$ and $pChoose_C$.\nSumming $K^2$ over all vertices $i$, we
      get a time of $O(N^2)$, which gets full\ncredit.\nA full solution by Rain:\n\n#include

      3: Luxury River Cruise [Josh Alman and Nathan Pinsker, 2013]\n\nFarmer John
      is taking Bessie and the cows on a cruise! They are sailing on a \nnetwork of
      rivers with N ports (1 <= N <= 1,000) labeled 1..N, and Bessie \nstarts at port
      1. Each port has exactly two rivers leading out of it which \nlead directly
      to other ports, and rivers can only be sailed one way.\n\nAt each port, the
      tour guides choose either the \"left\" river or the \"right\" \nriver to sail
      down next, but they keep repeating the same choices over and \nover. More specifically,
      the tour guides have chosen a short sequence of M \ndirections (1 <= M <= 500),
      each either \"left\" or \"right\", and have\nrepeated it K times (1 <= K <=
      1,000,000,000). Bessie thinks she is going\nin circles -- help her figure out
      where she ends up!\n\nPROBLEM NAME: cruise\n\nINPUT FORMAT:\n\n* Line 1: Three
      space-separated integers N, M, and K.\n\n* Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 has two space-separated
      integers,\n        representing the number of the ports that port i''s left

      problem involves simulating movement through a network of ports based on a repeating
      sequence of left/right directions. The key aspects are:\n1. The network of ports
      is represented as a graph, where each port has a \"left\" and \"right\" outgoing
      edge to other ports. \n2. A sequence of M left/right directions is given, which
      is repeated K times.\n3. We need to determine the final port after following
      this repeated sequence starting from port 1.\n\nTo solve this, we can:\n1. Read
      in the port graph and store the left/right destinations for each port\n2. Simulate
      the movement:\n   - Maintain a current port\n   - For each direction in the
      sequence:\n     - If ''L'', move to the left port, else move to the right port\n   -
      Repeat the sequence K times in total\n3. Output the final port\n\nThe number
      of repetitions K can be very large (up to 1 billion), so we need to find a way
      to avoid simulating all K repetitions. \n\nOne optimization is to notice that
      if we ever visit the same port twice at the same point in the direction sequence,
      we have entered a cycle. We can fast-forward by calculating how many full cycles
      are left.\n\nSo an optimized approach would be:\n1. Simulate the first M * N
      steps, keeping track of the port and position in the sequence for each step\n2.
      If a cycle is detected (same port and sequence position seen before):\n   -
      Calculate remaining number of cycles\n   - Fast-forward to the same point in
      the last cycle\n3. Finish simulating any remaining steps\n4. Output the final
      port\n\nThe time complexity will be O(M * N) and space complexity O(M * N) to
      store the state at each step for cycle detection.\n</thinking>","type":"text"},{"id":"toolu_01TCbGzzL5B2sa5xFezRTVMJ","input":{"reasoning":"We

      previously solved the following problems in this competition:\n    <Examples>\n    <problem>\n    Farmer
      John has $N$ ($1 \\le {N} \\le {10^5}$) cows, the breed of each being\neither
      a Guernsey or a Holstein. They have lined up horizontally with the cows occupying
      positions \nlabeled from\n$1\\dots N$.\n\nSince all the cows are hungry, FJ
      decides to plant grassy patches on some\nof the positions $1\\dots N$. Guernseys
      and Holsteins prefer different types of\ngrass, so if Farmer John decides to
      plant grass at some location, he must choose\nto planting either Guernsey-preferred
      grass or Holstein-preferred grass --- he\ncannot plant both at the same location.
      Each patch of grass planted can feed an\nunlimited number of cows of the appropriate
      breed. \n\nEach cow is willing to move a maximum of $K$ ($0 \\le {K} \\le N-1$)
      positions to\nreach a patch. Find the minimum number of patches needed to feed

      containing $N$ and $K$. The next line will\ncontain a string of length $N$,
      where each character denotes the breed of the\n$i$th cow (G meaning Guernsey
      and H meaning Holstein).\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):\nFor

      all the cows with the minimum number of patches. The $i$th character,\ndescribing
      the $i$th position, should be a ''.'' if there is no patch, a ''G'' if\nthere
      is a patch that feeds Guernseys, and a ''H'' if it feeds Holsteins. Any\nvalid

      to feed all cows while using the minimum number of patches. For example,\nin
      the fourth test case, another acceptable answer would be:\n\n\n.GH..\n\nThis
      corresponds to placing a patch feeding Guernseys on the 2nd position and a\npatch
      feeding Holsteins on the third position. This uses the optimal number of\npatches

      by Mythreya Dharani)\nLet''s start by defining a cow as covered if there is
      a patch feeding its\nbreed within a distance of $K$. The problem is asking us
      to cover all cows with\nthe minimum number of patches.\nConsider each cow $i$
      from $1 \\dots N$ in that order, placing patches whenever\nnecessary. First
      of all, if the current cow is already covered,  then we don''t\nneed to place
      another patch, and we can just move on. Otherwise, we need to\nplace a new patch
      for this cow, so where would we place it? Consider what\nhappens if we place
      the patch at position $i + K$. Not only will cow $i$ be\ncovered but any cows
      after it which are within $K$ distance of that patch will\nalso be covered.
      In fact, placing it at this location maximizes the number of\npotential cows
      that can be covered. \nThus, we can just implement this strategy starting at
      cow $1$. Keep in mind that\nif there is a cow $i$ which needs to be fed and
      $i + K > N$, we can just place\nour new patch at position $i$ since all remaining
      same-breed cows can feed off\nthat patch. This solution runs in $O(N)$ time
      since we are just doing a single\npass over the $N$ cows.\nThere is actually
      one edge case; what if when we try to place a patch at\nposition $i$ but there
      is already a patch there? In this case, we can place the\npatch at $i-1$ instead,
      as it may be proven that there can''t already be patches\nat both $i-1$ and
      $i$. As $i-1+K\\ge N$, this patch covers all cows from $i$ to\n$N$ of the same
      breed as cow $i$.\nMythreya Dharani''s C++ code:\n\n#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing

      by Rain Jiang, Benjamin Qi)\nRestating the problem:\nYou are given an undirected
      graph, such that each edge belongs to at most one\nsimple cycle. Such a graph
      is called a\ncactus.\nYou start walking at vertex $1$. Every time you are at
      any vertex $i$, do the\nfollowing:\nWith a probability of $p_i$, end the walk.Otherwise,
      if there are no untraversed edges adjacent to $i$, end the\nwalk.Otherwise,
      choose an untraversed edge adjacent to $i$ uniformly randomly,\nand traverse
      it.\nFor all vertices $i$, you want to find the probability that you end your
      walk at\n$i$. Let''s call this probability $ans_i$.\nLet $d_i$ be $\\deg(i)$
      if $i=1$, and $\\deg(i)-1$ otherwise.\nLet $K$ be the maximum number of cycles
      that any vertex belongs to.\nSubtask 1: $N \\le 11$.\nFrom $N \\le 11$, we can
      see that\n$M \\le \\frac{3}{2} (N - 1) \\le \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot 10 = 15$.\nWith
      these bounds, an $O(2^M \\cdot M)$ DP is sufficient.\nLet $dp_{i, E}$ be the
      probability that you reach a state where you''re at vertex\n$i$, and the set
      of untraversed edges is $E$.\nLet''s see how to transition from $dp_{i, E}$
      to other states.\nLet $E''$ be the set of edges in $E$ adjacent to $i$.\nIf
      $E''$ is empty, we add $dp_{i, E}$ to $ans_i$.\nOtherwise, we add $dp_{i, E}
      \\cdot p_i$ to $ans_i$. Also, for each edge\n$e = \\{i, j\\} \\in E''$ adjacent
      to $i$, we add\n$dp_{i, E} \\cdot (1 - p_i) \\cdot \\frac{1}{|E''|}$ to\n$dp_{j,
      E \\setminus \\{e\\}}$,\nBecause the time spent on transitions from any $dp_{i,
      E}$ is $O(\\deg(i))$, and\nthe sum of $\\deg(i)$ is $O(M)$, the total time taken
      for this DP is\n$O(2^M \\cdot M)$.\nRain''s code:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include

      all\nof Bessie''s possible walks. The number of walks is bounded above by\n$N\\cdot
      3^{(\\#\\text{ simple cycles})}\\cdot \\prod_{1\\le i\\le N}(\\#\\text{ simple
      cycles adjacent to }i)!$\nbecause if we:\nFix Bessie''s ending vertex (choices:
      $N$)For each simple cycle, decide which direction to traverse it in, or not\ntraverse
      it at all (choices: $3^{(\\#\\text{ simple cycles})}$)For each vertex, decide
      in what order we will traverse the simple cycles\nadjacent to it (choices:\n$\\prod_{1\\le
      i\\le N}(\\#\\text{ simple cycles adjacent to }i)!$).\nthen Bessie''s walk is
      uniquely determined. For $N\\le 11$, the number of simple\ncycles is at most  $(N-1)/2\\le
      5$, so the total number of walks cannot be very\nlarge.\nSubtask 3: $K \\le
      1$.\nThe graph is a vertex-disjoint cactus. We need to modify the algorithm
      from\nSubtask 2 to handle cycles.\nAgain, root the cactus at vertex $1$, and
      consider the\nDFS tree of this cactus. Since we\ndid DFS, each cycle can be
      represented as path from a vertex to one of its\ndescendants, plus the corresponding
      back edge. Let''s call this highest vertex\nthe top vertex of the cycle.\nYou
      can see that the path generally moves downward, with occasional roundabouts\nalong
      cycles.\nSimilar to Subtask 2, let $pVisit_i$ be the probability that you reach
      vertex\n$i$ from the root.\nThe transitions using a non-cycle edge can be handled
      similar to Subtask 2.\nLet''s see how to transition using cycle edges. Let $i$
      be the top vertex of\ncycle $C$.\nWe describe how to transition from $i$ to
      another vertex $j$ on cycle $C$. We\ncan see that $pVisit_j$ is the sum of the
      two probabilities of going from $i$ to\n$j$, by choosing one of two paths going
      from $i$ to $j$ along $C$. The\nprobability of traversing one such path is the
      product of $pVisit_i$ and\n$(1 - p_u) \\cdot \\frac{1}{d_u}$ for all vertices
      $u$ along that path.\nYou should also handle the special case of traversing
      the whole cycle $C$ and\nvisiting $i$ a second time. The probability of this
      occurring is similar to the\nabove. After we traverse $C$, there are no more
      cycle edges adjacent to $i$, so\nwe are forced to either stop at $i$ or traverse
      an adjacent non-cycle edge.\nWe can do this using a DFS from vertex $1$. We
      process each cycle $C$ by going\nthrough it twice, once in each direction, taking
      $O(|C|)$ time.\nTime complexity: $O(M)$.\nRain''s code:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include

      5, 6\nAs in earlier subtasks, root the cactus at vertex $1$ and consider the
      DFS tree\nof it.\nHowever, the path is more complex: it can go down the tree
      for quite a while,\nbut eventually retrace and traverse another path.\nLet''s
      define a few terms. Fix vertex $i$. Consider the edge $f$ from $i$ to its\nparent.
      By the assumption that the graph is a cactus, $f$ must either be a\nbridge or
      is\ncontained in a (unique) cycle $C$. (From now on, when we say \"bridge\",
      we mean\nit in the graph theory sense.) If $f$ is a bridge, then call $pb_i=f$
      the\nparent bridge of $i$. Otherwise, call $pc_i=C$ the parent cycle of\n$i$.\nIn
      any case, let the predecessor of vertex $i$ be either its parent (if\n$f$ is
      a bridge) or the top vertex of $pc_i$ (if $f$ isn''t a bridge.)\nSymmetrically,
      $i$ is a successor of its predecessor.\nAlso, let the subcactus of $i$ be the
      connected subgraph containing $i$\nobtained by deleting $pb_i$ or all edges
      of $pc_i$. Let $T_i$ be the subcactus\nof $i$.\nLet''s observe what edges adjacent
      to vertex $i$ are untraversed when we visit\n$i$ for the first time. Consider
      two cases (recall that $f$ is the edge from $i$\nto its parent):\n\n$f$ is a
      bridge. If $i \\neq 1$, the only way to visit $i$ is through\n$pb_i$. We cannot
      use $pb_i$ twice, so we must stay in $T_i$ from now on.\n\n$f$ is not a bridge.
      We must enter $i$ via one of two adjacent edges in\n$pc_i$. In either case,
      all untraversed edges from $i$ are in $T_i$, except the\nother cycle edge. Indeed,
      this edge is the only edge that can be used to escape\n$T_i$, and once we use
      it, we can never go back to any vertex in $T_i$. We refer\nto this edge as the
      \"escape edge\" of $i$.\n\nThis motivates us to compute the following two DPs:\n$pEscape_i$
      -- the probability that, starting from $i$, we eventually use the\n\"escape
      edge\" from $i$ (For convenience later, let $pEscape_i = 0$ if there is\nno
      such \"escape edge\".)\n$qVisit_{i, j}$ -- the probability that, starting from
      $i$, we visit one of its\nsuccessors $j$.\nIf we have these two DPs, we can
      compute the answer using a DFS from vertex $1$\nas follows.\nSuppose the DFS
      reaches $i$. Let $pVisit_i$ be defined similar to Subtasks 2 and\n3.\nFor a
      successor $j$ of $i$, set $pVisit_j = pVisit_i \\cdot qVisit_{i, j}$, and\nrecurse
      on $j$.\nFinally, let''s compute $ans_i$. You end up at vertex $i$ if you visit
      vertex\n$i$, and you don''t do either of the following:\n\nUse the \"escape
      edge\" from $i$.\n\nEventually reach a successor $j$, and never escape from
      its subcactus.\n\nSince all bad cases above are mutually exclusive, we have\n$$\nans_i
      = pVisit_i \\cdot \\left(1 - pEscape_i - \\sum_{j\\:\\textrm{is a successor
      of}\\:i} qVisit_{i, j} \\left(1 - pEscape_j\\right)\\right)\n$$\nSince each
      vertex has a unique predecessor, the time to compute $ans_i$ from\n$pEscape$
      and $qVisit$ is $O(M)$.\nLet''s compute $pEscape$ and $qVisit$ in a bottom-up
      fashion. Suppose we want to\ncompute them for $i$.\nLet $qEscape_C$ for a cycle
      $C$ with top vertex $i$ be equal to the product of\n$pEscape_j$ for all vertices
      $j \\in C$ excluding $i$. In other words, this is\nthe probability that you
      can complete one traversal of $C$ from $i$ and end up\nback at $i$. \nLet $CC$
      be the set of cycles that $i$ is the top vertex of.\nThere are two things we
      need to calculate:\n$pChoose_{bridge}$ -- The probability of eventually choosing
      a certain bridge\nadjacent to $i$ (or the \"escape edge\" of $i$).\n$pChoose_C$
      -- The probability of eventually choosing one of two edges adjacent\nto $i$
      on a cycle\n$C \\in CC$.\nUsing these, we can compute $pEscape_i$ and $qVisit_{i,
      j}$ as follows:\n\n$qVisit_{i, j}$ on bridges $\\{i, j\\}$ (and $pEscape_i$,
      if there is an \"escape\nedge\") are equal to $pChoose_{bridge}$.\n\nWe are
      left with computing $qVisit_{i, j}$ for all $j$ on a cycle $C \\in CC$.\nAny
      corresponding path must eventually select one of two edges adjacent to $i$\non
      $C$, and traverse the path from $i$ to $j$ along that edge. The probability\nof
      this happening is the product of $pChoose_C$ and $pEscape_{u}$ for all $u$\nalong
      this path. So $qVisit_{i, j}$ can be computed in a similar way as in\nSubtask
      3.\n\nThe next few paragraphs describe how to compute $pChoose_{bridge}$ and\n$pChoose_C$
      for $C \\in CC$ fast.\nLet''s consider $pChoose_{bridge}$. Any corresponding
      path can be described as a\ntraversal of some subset of cycles $C_0, C_1, ...,
      C_{k-1}$, in this order, plus\nthe extra edge.\nSo $pChoose_{bridge}$ is the
      sum of the following over all ordered subsets\n$C_0, C_1, ..., C_{k-1}$:\n$$\n\\left(\\prod_{h=0}^{k-1}
      \\left(1 - p_i\\right) \\cdot \\frac{2}{d_i-2h} \\cdot qEscape_{C_h}\\right)
      \\cdot \\left(1 - p_i\\right) \\cdot \\frac{1}{d_i-2k}\n$$\nAlso, the above
      term doesn''t change if we permute $C_0, C_1, ..., C_{k-1}$, so\nlet''s instead
      sum over all subsets $S \\subseteq CC$:\n$$\npChoose_{bridge} = \\sum_{S \\subseteq
      CC} \\left(k! \\cdot \\left(1 - p_i\\right)^{k+1} \\cdot 2^k \\cdot \\left(\\prod_{h=0}^{k}
      \\frac{1}{d_i-2h}\\right) \\cdot \\prod_{C \\in S} qEscape_{C}\\right)\n$$\n$pChoose_C$
      for $C \\in CC$ can be calculated in the same way, except that in the\nabove
      formula we use $CC \\setminus \\{C\\}$ instead of $CC$.\nCalculating the above
      sums straightforwardly takes $O(2^K \\cdot K^2)$ time, and\nthis passes Subtask
      4 where $K \\le 5$.\nLet''s make it faster. Note that the terms with the same
      $k$ in the above formula\nhave a common factor, namely\n$w_k = k! \\cdot (1
      - p_i)^{k+1} \\cdot 2^k \\cdot (\\prod_{h=0}^{k} \\frac{1}{d_i-2h})$.\nFactoring
      this out, it suffices to compute the sum of\n$\\prod_{C \\in S} qEscape_{C}$
      for all subsets $S \\in CC$ of size $k$.\nWe can do this using generating functions.
      Consider the generating function\n$$\nF(x) = \\prod_{C \\in CC} \\left(1 + qEscape_C
      x\\right)\n$$\nOnce we get this generating function, we add $w_k \\cdot F(x)
      [x^k]$ for all $k$\nto get $pChoose_{bridge}$. We can calculate $pChoose_C$
      for $C \\in CC$\nsimilarly, except that we use $CC \\setminus \\{C\\}$ instead
      of $CC$.\nThe generating function has degree $K$, so multiplying $(1 + qEscape_C
      x)$ takes\n$O(K)$ time. Thus it takes $O(K^2)$ time to calculate $F(x)$, and
      doing this for\nall $O(K)$ probabilities takes $O(K^3)$.\nThe sum of $K$ is
      $O(N)$, so the sum of $K^3$ for the above solution is\n$O(N \\cdot K^2)$. This
      is enough to pass subtask 5, where $K \\le 50$.\nRain''s code for Subtask 5:\n\n#include

      we need to compute $pChoose_{bridge}$ and $pChoose_C$ in\n$O(K^2)$ time.\nNotice
      that the generating function we calculate for $pChoose_C$ is almost the\nsame
      as the one for $pChoose_{bridge}$, but is missing a factor of\n$(1 + qEscape_C
      x)$. This factor can be removed in $O(K)$ time (To divide such a\npolynomial,
      we perform steps backward as when we multiply.)\nIn summary, we spend $O(K)$
      divisions and multiplications, $O(K)$ time for\ncomputing $O(K)$ probabilities
      from the generating function, so in total we\nspend $O(K^2)$ time to compute
      $pChoose_{bridge}$ and $pChoose_C$.\nSumming $K^2$ over all vertices $i$, we

      3: Luxury River Cruise [Josh Alman and Nathan Pinsker, 2013]\n\nFarmer John
      is taking Bessie and the cows on a cruise! They are sailing on a \nnetwork of
      rivers with N ports (1 <= N <= 1,000) labeled 1..N, and Bessie \nstarts at port
      1. Each port has exactly two rivers leading out of it which \nlead directly
      to other ports, and rivers can only be sailed one way.\n\nAt each port, the
      tour guides choose either the \"left\" river or the \"right\" \nriver to sail
      down next, but they keep repeating the same choices over and \nover. More specifically,
      the tour guides have chosen a short sequence of M \ndirections (1 <= M <= 500),
      each either \"left\" or \"right\", and have\nrepeated it K times (1 <= K <=
      1,000,000,000). Bessie thinks she is going\nin circles -- help her figure out
      where she ends up!\n\nPROBLEM NAME: cruise\n\nINPUT FORMAT:\n\n* Line 1: Three

      problem involves simulating movement through a network of ports based on a repeating
      sequence of left/right directions. The key aspects are:\n1. The network of ports
      is represented as a graph, where each port has a \"left\" and \"right\" outgoing
      edge to other ports. \n2. A sequence of M left/right directions is given, which
      is repeated K times.\n3. We need to determine the final port after following
      this repeated sequence starting from port 1.\n\nTo solve this, we can:\n1. Read
      in the port graph and store the left/right destinations for each port\n2. Simulate
      the movement:\n   - Maintain a current port\n   - For each direction in the
      sequence:\n     - If ''L'', move to the left port, else move to the right port\n   -
      Repeat the sequence K times in total\n3. Output the final port\n\nThe number
      of repetitions K can be very large (up to 1 billion), so we need to find a way
      to avoid simulating all K repetitions. \n\nOne optimization is to notice that
      if we ever visit the same port twice at the same point in the direction sequence,
      we have entered a cycle. We can fast-forward by calculating how many full cycles
      are left.\n\nSo an optimized approach would be:\n1. Simulate the first M * N
      steps, keeping track of the port and position in the sequence for each step\n2.
      If a cycle is detected (same port and sequence position seen before):\n   -
      Calculate remaining number of cycles\n   - Fast-forward to the same point in
      the last cycle\n3. Finish simulating any remaining steps\n4. Output the final
      port\n\nThe time complexity will be O(M * N) and space complexity O(M * N) to

      by Mythreya Dharani)\nLet''s start by defining a cow as covered if there is
      a patch feeding its\nbreed within a distance of $K$. The problem is asking us
      to cover all cows with\nthe minimum number of patches.\nConsider each cow $i$
      from $1 \\dots N$ in that order, placing patches whenever\nnecessary. First
      of all, if the current cow is already covered,  then we don''t\nneed to place
      another patch, and we can just move on. Otherwise, we need to\nplace a new patch
      for this cow, so where would we place it? Consider what\nhappens if we place
      the patch at position $i + K$. Not only will cow $i$ be\ncovered but any cows
      after it which are within $K$ distance of that patch will\nalso be covered.
      In fact, placing it at this location maximizes the number of\npotential cows
      that can be covered. \nThus, we can just implement this strategy starting at
      cow $1$. Keep in mind that\nif there is a cow $i$ which needs to be fed and
      $i + K > N$, we can just place\nour new patch at position $i$ since all remaining
      same-breed cows can feed off\nthat patch. This solution runs in $O(N)$ time
      since we are just doing a single\npass over the $N$ cows.\nThere is actually
      one edge case; what if when we try to place a patch at\nposition $i$ but there
      is already a patch there? In this case, we can place the\npatch at $i-1$ instead,
      as it may be proven that there can''t already be patches\nat both $i-1$ and
      $i$. As $i-1+K\\ge N$, this patch covers all cows from $i$ to\n$N$ of the same
      breed as cow $i$.\nMythreya Dharani''s C++ code:\n\n#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing

      by Rain Jiang, Benjamin Qi)\nRestating the problem:\nYou are given an undirected
      graph, such that each edge belongs to at most one\nsimple cycle. Such a graph
      is called a\ncactus.\nYou start walking at vertex $1$. Every time you are at
      any vertex $i$, do the\nfollowing:\nWith a probability of $p_i$, end the walk.Otherwise,
      if there are no untraversed edges adjacent to $i$, end the\nwalk.Otherwise,
      choose an untraversed edge adjacent to $i$ uniformly randomly,\nand traverse
      it.\nFor all vertices $i$, you want to find the probability that you end your
      walk at\n$i$. Let''s call this probability $ans_i$.\nLet $d_i$ be $\\deg(i)$
      if $i=1$, and $\\deg(i)-1$ otherwise.\nLet $K$ be the maximum number of cycles
      that any vertex belongs to.\nSubtask 1: $N \\le 11$.\nFrom $N \\le 11$, we can
      see that\n$M \\le \\frac{3}{2} (N - 1) \\le \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot 10 = 15$.\nWith
      these bounds, an $O(2^M \\cdot M)$ DP is sufficient.\nLet $dp_{i, E}$ be the
      probability that you reach a state where you''re at vertex\n$i$, and the set
      of untraversed edges is $E$.\nLet''s see how to transition from $dp_{i, E}$
      to other states.\nLet $E''$ be the set of edges in $E$ adjacent to $i$.\nIf
      $E''$ is empty, we add $dp_{i, E}$ to $ans_i$.\nOtherwise, we add $dp_{i, E}
      \\cdot p_i$ to $ans_i$. Also, for each edge\n$e = \\{i, j\\} \\in E''$ adjacent
      to $i$, we add\n$dp_{i, E} \\cdot (1 - p_i) \\cdot \\frac{1}{|E''|}$ to\n$dp_{j,
      E \\setminus \\{e\\}}$,\nBecause the time spent on transitions from any $dp_{i,
      E}$ is $O(\\deg(i))$, and\nthe sum of $\\deg(i)$ is $O(M)$, the total time taken
      for this DP is\n$O(2^M \\cdot M)$.\nRain''s code:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include

      all\nof Bessie''s possible walks. The number of walks is bounded above by\n$N\\cdot
      3^{(\\#\\text{ simple cycles})}\\cdot \\prod_{1\\le i\\le N}(\\#\\text{ simple
      cycles adjacent to }i)!$\nbecause if we:\nFix Bessie''s ending vertex (choices:
      $N$)For each simple cycle, decide which direction to traverse it in, or not\ntraverse
      it at all (choices: $3^{(\\#\\text{ simple cycles})}$)For each vertex, decide
      in what order we will traverse the simple cycles\nadjacent to it (choices:\n$\\prod_{1\\le
      i\\le N}(\\#\\text{ simple cycles adjacent to }i)!$).\nthen Bessie''s walk is
      uniquely determined. For $N\\le 11$, the number of simple\ncycles is at most  $(N-1)/2\\le
      5$, so the total number of walks cannot be very\nlarge.\nSubtask 3: $K \\le
      1$.\nThe graph is a vertex-disjoint cactus. We need to modify the algorithm
      from\nSubtask 2 to handle cycles.\nAgain, root the cactus at vertex $1$, and
      consider the\nDFS tree of this cactus. Since we\ndid DFS, each cycle can be
      represented as path from a vertex to one of its\ndescendants, plus the corresponding
      back edge. Let''s call this highest vertex\nthe top vertex of the cycle.\nYou
      can see that the path generally moves downward, with occasional roundabouts\nalong
      cycles.\nSimilar to Subtask 2, let $pVisit_i$ be the probability that you reach
      vertex\n$i$ from the root.\nThe transitions using a non-cycle edge can be handled
      similar to Subtask 2.\nLet''s see how to transition using cycle edges. Let $i$
      be the top vertex of\ncycle $C$.\nWe describe how to transition from $i$ to
      another vertex $j$ on cycle $C$. We\ncan see that $pVisit_j$ is the sum of the
      two probabilities of going from $i$ to\n$j$, by choosing one of two paths going
      from $i$ to $j$ along $C$. The\nprobability of traversing one such path is the
      product of $pVisit_i$ and\n$(1 - p_u) \\cdot \\frac{1}{d_u}$ for all vertices
      $u$ along that path.\nYou should also handle the special case of traversing
      the whole cycle $C$ and\nvisiting $i$ a second time. The probability of this
      occurring is similar to the\nabove. After we traverse $C$, there are no more
      cycle edges adjacent to $i$, so\nwe are forced to either stop at $i$ or traverse
      an adjacent non-cycle edge.\nWe can do this using a DFS from vertex $1$. We
      process each cycle $C$ by going\nthrough it twice, once in each direction, taking
      $O(|C|)$ time.\nTime complexity: $O(M)$.\nRain''s code:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include

      5, 6\nAs in earlier subtasks, root the cactus at vertex $1$ and consider the
      DFS tree\nof it.\nHowever, the path is more complex: it can go down the tree
      for quite a while,\nbut eventually retrace and traverse another path.\nLet''s
      define a few terms. Fix vertex $i$. Consider the edge $f$ from $i$ to its\nparent.
      By the assumption that the graph is a cactus, $f$ must either be a\nbridge or
      is\ncontained in a (unique) cycle $C$. (From now on, when we say \"bridge\",
      we mean\nit in the graph theory sense.) If $f$ is a bridge, then call $pb_i=f$
      the\nparent bridge of $i$. Otherwise, call $pc_i=C$ the parent cycle of\n$i$.\nIn
      any case, let the predecessor of vertex $i$ be either its parent (if\n$f$ is
      a bridge) or the top vertex of $pc_i$ (if $f$ isn''t a bridge.)\nSymmetrically,
      $i$ is a successor of its predecessor.\nAlso, let the subcactus of $i$ be the
      connected subgraph containing $i$\nobtained by deleting $pb_i$ or all edges
      of $pc_i$. Let $T_i$ be the subcactus\nof $i$.\nLet''s observe what edges adjacent
      to vertex $i$ are untraversed when we visit\n$i$ for the first time. Consider
      two cases (recall that $f$ is the edge from $i$\nto its parent):\n\n$f$ is a
      bridge. If $i \\neq 1$, the only way to visit $i$ is through\n$pb_i$. We cannot
      use $pb_i$ twice, so we must stay in $T_i$ from now on.\n\n$f$ is not a bridge.
      We must enter $i$ via one of two adjacent edges in\n$pc_i$. In either case,
      all untraversed edges from $i$ are in $T_i$, except the\nother cycle edge. Indeed,
      this edge is the only edge that can be used to escape\n$T_i$, and once we use
      it, we can never go back to any vertex in $T_i$. We refer\nto this edge as the
      \"escape edge\" of $i$.\n\nThis motivates us to compute the following two DPs:\n$pEscape_i$
      -- the probability that, starting from $i$, we eventually use the\n\"escape
      edge\" from $i$ (For convenience later, let $pEscape_i = 0$ if there is\nno
      such \"escape edge\".)\n$qVisit_{i, j}$ -- the probability that, starting from
      $i$, we visit one of its\nsuccessors $j$.\nIf we have these two DPs, we can
      compute the answer using a DFS from vertex $1$\nas follows.\nSuppose the DFS
      reaches $i$. Let $pVisit_i$ be defined similar to Subtasks 2 and\n3.\nFor a
      successor $j$ of $i$, set $pVisit_j = pVisit_i \\cdot qVisit_{i, j}$, and\nrecurse
      on $j$.\nFinally, let''s compute $ans_i$. You end up at vertex $i$ if you visit
      vertex\n$i$, and you don''t do either of the following:\n\nUse the \"escape
      edge\" from $i$.\n\nEventually reach a successor $j$, and never escape from
      its subcactus.\n\nSince all bad cases above are mutually exclusive, we have\n$$\nans_i
      = pVisit_i \\cdot \\left(1 - pEscape_i - \\sum_{j\\:\\textrm{is a successor
      of}\\:i} qVisit_{i, j} \\left(1 - pEscape_j\\right)\\right)\n$$\nSince each
      vertex has a unique predecessor, the time to compute $ans_i$ from\n$pEscape$
      and $qVisit$ is $O(M)$.\nLet''s compute $pEscape$ and $qVisit$ in a bottom-up
      fashion. Suppose we want to\ncompute them for $i$.\nLet $qEscape_C$ for a cycle
      $C$ with top vertex $i$ be equal to the product of\n$pEscape_j$ for all vertices
      $j \\in C$ excluding $i$. In other words, this is\nthe probability that you
      can complete one traversal of $C$ from $i$ and end up\nback at $i$. \nLet $CC$
      be the set of cycles that $i$ is the top vertex of.\nThere are two things we
      need to calculate:\n$pChoose_{bridge}$ -- The probability of eventually choosing
      a certain bridge\nadjacent to $i$ (or the \"escape edge\" of $i$).\n$pChoose_C$
      -- The probability of eventually choosing one of two edges adjacent\nto $i$
      on a cycle\n$C \\in CC$.\nUsing these, we can compute $pEscape_i$ and $qVisit_{i,
      j}$ as follows:\n\n$qVisit_{i, j}$ on bridges $\\{i, j\\}$ (and $pEscape_i$,
      if there is an \"escape\nedge\") are equal to $pChoose_{bridge}$.\n\nWe are
      left with computing $qVisit_{i, j}$ for all $j$ on a cycle $C \\in CC$.\nAny
      corresponding path must eventually select one of two edges adjacent to $i$\non
      $C$, and traverse the path from $i$ to $j$ along that edge. The probability\nof
      this happening is the product of $pChoose_C$ and $pEscape_{u}$ for all $u$\nalong
      this path. So $qVisit_{i, j}$ can be computed in a similar way as in\nSubtask
      3.\n\nThe next few paragraphs describe how to compute $pChoose_{bridge}$ and\n$pChoose_C$
      for $C \\in CC$ fast.\nLet''s consider $pChoose_{bridge}$. Any corresponding
      path can be described as a\ntraversal of some subset of cycles $C_0, C_1, ...,
      C_{k-1}$, in this order, plus\nthe extra edge.\nSo $pChoose_{bridge}$ is the
      sum of the following over all ordered subsets\n$C_0, C_1, ..., C_{k-1}$:\n$$\n\\left(\\prod_{h=0}^{k-1}
      \\left(1 - p_i\\right) \\cdot \\frac{2}{d_i-2h} \\cdot qEscape_{C_h}\\right)
      \\cdot \\left(1 - p_i\\right) \\cdot \\frac{1}{d_i-2k}\n$$\nAlso, the above
      term doesn''t change if we permute $C_0, C_1, ..., C_{k-1}$, so\nlet''s instead
      sum over all subsets $S \\subseteq CC$:\n$$\npChoose_{bridge} = \\sum_{S \\subseteq
      CC} \\left(k! \\cdot \\left(1 - p_i\\right)^{k+1} \\cdot 2^k \\cdot \\left(\\prod_{h=0}^{k}
      \\frac{1}{d_i-2h}\\right) \\cdot \\prod_{C \\in S} qEscape_{C}\\right)\n$$\n$pChoose_C$
      for $C \\in CC$ can be calculated in the same way, except that in the\nabove
      formula we use $CC \\setminus \\{C\\}$ instead of $CC$.\nCalculating the above
      sums straightforwardly takes $O(2^K \\cdot K^2)$ time, and\nthis passes Subtask
      4 where $K \\le 5$.\nLet''s make it faster. Note that the terms with the same
      $k$ in the above formula\nhave a common factor, namely\n$w_k = k! \\cdot (1
      - p_i)^{k+1} \\cdot 2^k \\cdot (\\prod_{h=0}^{k} \\frac{1}{d_i-2h})$.\nFactoring
      this out, it suffices to compute the sum of\n$\\prod_{C \\in S} qEscape_{C}$
      for all subsets $S \\in CC$ of size $k$.\nWe can do this using generating functions.
      Consider the generating function\n$$\nF(x) = \\prod_{C \\in CC} \\left(1 + qEscape_C
      x\\right)\n$$\nOnce we get this generating function, we add $w_k \\cdot F(x)
      [x^k]$ for all $k$\nto get $pChoose_{bridge}$. We can calculate $pChoose_C$
      for $C \\in CC$\nsimilarly, except that we use $CC \\setminus \\{C\\}$ instead
      of $CC$.\nThe generating function has degree $K$, so multiplying $(1 + qEscape_C
      x)$ takes\n$O(K)$ time. Thus it takes $O(K^2)$ time to calculate $F(x)$, and
      doing this for\nall $O(K)$ probabilities takes $O(K^3)$.\nThe sum of $K$ is
      $O(N)$, so the sum of $K^3$ for the above solution is\n$O(N \\cdot K^2)$. This
      is enough to pass subtask 5, where $K \\le 50$.\nRain''s code for Subtask 5:\n\n#include

      we need to compute $pChoose_{bridge}$ and $pChoose_C$ in\n$O(K^2)$ time.\nNotice
      that the generating function we calculate for $pChoose_C$ is almost the\nsame
      as the one for $pChoose_{bridge}$, but is missing a factor of\n$(1 + qEscape_C
      x)$. This factor can be removed in $O(K)$ time (To divide such a\npolynomial,
      we perform steps backward as when we multiply.)\nIn summary, we spend $O(K)$
      divisions and multiplications, $O(K)$ time for\ncomputing $O(K)$ probabilities
      from the generating function, so in total we\nspend $O(K^2)$ time to compute
      $pChoose_{bridge}$ and $pChoose_C$.\nSumming $K^2$ over all vertices $i$, we
      get a time of $O(N^2)$, which gets full\ncredit.\nA full solution by Rain:\n\n#include

      this new question with similar sophistication.","test_cases":"..."},"outputs":{"output":{"content":[{"text":"<thinking>\nThis
      problem involves simulating movement through a network of ports based on a repeating
      sequence of left/right directions. The key aspects are:\n1. The network of ports
      is represented as a graph, where each port has a \"left\" and \"right\" outgoing
      edge to other ports. \n2. A sequence of M left/right directions is given, which
      is repeated K times.\n3. We need to determine the final port after following
      this repeated sequence starting from port 1.\n\nTo solve this, we can:\n1. Read
      in the port graph and store the left/right destinations for each port\n2. Simulate
      the movement:\n   - Maintain a current port\n   - For each direction in the
      sequence:\n     - If ''L'', move to the left port, else move to the right port\n   -
      Repeat the sequence K times in total\n3. Output the final port\n\nThe number
      of repetitions K can be very large (up to 1 billion), so we need to find a way
      to avoid simulating all K repetitions. \n\nOne optimization is to notice that
      if we ever visit the same port twice at the same point in the direction sequence,
      we have entered a cycle. We can fast-forward by calculating how many full cycles
      are left.\n\nSo an optimized approach would be:\n1. Simulate the first M * N
      steps, keeping track of the port and position in the sequence for each step\n2.
      If a cycle is detected (same port and sequence position seen before):\n   -
      Calculate remaining number of cycles\n   - Fast-forward to the same point in
      the last cycle\n3. Finish simulating any remaining steps\n4. Output the final
      port\n\nThe time complexity will be O(M * N) and space complexity O(M * N) to
      store the state at each step for cycle detection.\n</thinking>","type":"text"},{"id":"toolu_01TCbGzzL5B2sa5xFezRTVMJ","input":{"reasoning":"We

      \\le {N} \\le {10^5}$) cows, the breed of each being\neither a Guernsey or a
      Holstein. They have lined up horizontally with the cows occupying positions
      \nlabeled from\n$1\\dots N$.\n\nSince all the cows are hungry, FJ decides to
      plant grassy patches on some\nof the positions $1\\dots N$. Guernseys and Holsteins
      prefer different types of\ngrass, so if Farmer John decides to plant grass at
      some location, he must choose\nto planting either Guernsey-preferred grass or
      Holstein-preferred grass --- he\ncannot plant both at the same location. Each
      patch of grass planted can feed an\nunlimited number of cows of the appropriate
      breed. \n\nEach cow is willing to move a maximum of $K$ ($0 \\le {K} \\le N-1$)
      positions to\nreach a patch. Find the minimum number of patches needed to feed
      all the cows.\nAlso, print a configuration of patches that uses the minimum

      and H meaning Holstein).\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):\nFor

      another patch, and we can just move on. Otherwise, we need to\nplace a new patch
      for this cow, so where would we place it? Consider what\nhappens if we place
      the patch at position $i + K$. Not only will cow $i$ be\ncovered but any cows
      after it which are within $K$ distance of that patch will\nalso be covered.
      In fact, placing it at this location maximizes the number of\npotential cows
      that can be covered. \nThus, we can just implement this strategy starting at
      cow $1$. Keep in mind that\nif there is a cow $i$ which needs to be fed and
      $i + K > N$, we can just place\nour new patch at position $i$ since all remaining
      same-breed cows can feed off\nthat patch. This solution runs in $O(N)$ time
      since we are just doing a single\npass over the $N$ cows.\nThere is actually
      one edge case; what if when we try to place a patch at\nposition $i$ but there
      is already a patch there? In this case, we can place the\npatch at $i-1$ instead,
      as it may be proven that there can''t already be patches\nat both $i-1$ and
      $i$. As $i-1+K\\ge N$, this patch covers all cows from $i$ to\n$N$ of the same
      breed as cow $i$.\nMythreya Dharani''s C++ code:\n\n#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing

      by Rain Jiang, Benjamin Qi)\nRestating the problem:\nYou are given an undirected
      graph, such that each edge belongs to at most one\nsimple cycle. Such a graph
      is called a\ncactus.\nYou start walking at vertex $1$. Every time you are at
      any vertex $i$, do the\nfollowing:\nWith a probability of $p_i$, end the walk.Otherwise,
      if there are no untraversed edges adjacent to $i$, end the\nwalk.Otherwise,
      choose an untraversed edge adjacent to $i$ uniformly randomly,\nand traverse
      it.\nFor all vertices $i$, you want to find the probability that you end your
      walk at\n$i$. Let''s call this probability $ans_i$.\nLet $d_i$ be $\\deg(i)$
      if $i=1$, and $\\deg(i)-1$ otherwise.\nLet $K$ be the maximum number of cycles
      that any vertex belongs to.\nSubtask 1: $N \\le 11$.\nFrom $N \\le 11$, we can
      see that\n$M \\le \\frac{3}{2} (N - 1) \\le \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot 10 = 15$.\nWith
      these bounds, an $O(2^M \\cdot M)$ DP is sufficient.\nLet $dp_{i, E}$ be the
      probability that you reach a state where you''re at vertex\n$i$, and the set
      of untraversed edges is $E$.\nLet''s see how to transition from $dp_{i, E}$
      to other states.\nLet $E''$ be the set of edges in $E$ adjacent to $i$.\nIf
      $E''$ is empty, we add $dp_{i, E}$ to $ans_i$.\nOtherwise, we add $dp_{i, E}
      \\cdot p_i$ to $ans_i$. Also, for each edge\n$e = \\{i, j\\} \\in E''$ adjacent
      to $i$, we add\n$dp_{i, E} \\cdot (1 - p_i) \\cdot \\frac{1}{|E''|}$ to\n$dp_{j,
      E \\setminus \\{e\\}}$,\nBecause the time spent on transitions from any $dp_{i,
      E}$ is $O(\\deg(i))$, and\nthe sum of $\\deg(i)$ is $O(M)$, the total time taken
      for this DP is\n$O(2^M \\cdot M)$.\nRain''s code:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include

      all\nof Bessie''s possible walks. The number of walks is bounded above by\n$N\\cdot
      3^{(\\#\\text{ simple cycles})}\\cdot \\prod_{1\\le i\\le N}(\\#\\text{ simple
      cycles adjacent to }i)!$\nbecause if we:\nFix Bessie''s ending vertex (choices:
      $N$)For each simple cycle, decide which direction to traverse it in, or not\ntraverse
      it at all (choices: $3^{(\\#\\text{ simple cycles})}$)For each vertex, decide
      in what order we will traverse the simple cycles\nadjacent to it (choices:\n$\\prod_{1\\le
      i\\le N}(\\#\\text{ simple cycles adjacent to }i)!$).\nthen Bessie''s walk is
      uniquely determined. For $N\\le 11$, the number of simple\ncycles is at most  $(N-1)/2\\le
      5$, so the total number of walks cannot be very\nlarge.\nSubtask 3: $K \\le
      1$.\nThe graph is a vertex-disjoint cactus. We need to modify the algorithm
      from\nSubtask 2 to handle cycles.\nAgain, root the cactus at vertex $1$, and
      consider the\nDFS tree of this cactus. Since we\ndid DFS, each cycle can be
      represented as path from a vertex to one of its\ndescendants, plus the corresponding
      back edge. Let''s call this highest vertex\nthe top vertex of the cycle.\nYou
      can see that the path generally moves downward, with occasional roundabouts\nalong
      cycles.\nSimilar to Subtask 2, let $pVisit_i$ be the probability that you reach
      vertex\n$i$ from the root.\nThe transitions using a non-cycle edge can be handled
      similar to Subtask 2.\nLet''s see how to transition using cycle edges. Let $i$
      be the top vertex of\ncycle $C$.\nWe describe how to transition from $i$ to
      another vertex $j$ on cycle $C$. We\ncan see that $pVisit_j$ is the sum of the
      two probabilities of going from $i$ to\n$j$, by choosing one of two paths going
      from $i$ to $j$ along $C$. The\nprobability of traversing one such path is the
      product of $pVisit_i$ and\n$(1 - p_u) \\cdot \\frac{1}{d_u}$ for all vertices
      $u$ along that path.\nYou should also handle the special case of traversing
      the whole cycle $C$ and\nvisiting $i$ a second time. The probability of this
      occurring is similar to the\nabove. After we traverse $C$, there are no more
      cycle edges adjacent to $i$, so\nwe are forced to either stop at $i$ or traverse
      an adjacent non-cycle edge.\nWe can do this using a DFS from vertex $1$. We
      process each cycle $C$ by going\nthrough it twice, once in each direction, taking
      $O(|C|)$ time.\nTime complexity: $O(M)$.\nRain''s code:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include

      5, 6\nAs in earlier subtasks, root the cactus at vertex $1$ and consider the
      DFS tree\nof it.\nHowever, the path is more complex: it can go down the tree
      for quite a while,\nbut eventually retrace and traverse another path.\nLet''s
      define a few terms. Fix vertex $i$. Consider the edge $f$ from $i$ to its\nparent.
      By the assumption that the graph is a cactus, $f$ must either be a\nbridge or
      is\ncontained in a (unique) cycle $C$. (From now on, when we say \"bridge\",
      we mean\nit in the graph theory sense.) If $f$ is a bridge, then call $pb_i=f$
      the\nparent bridge of $i$. Otherwise, call $pc_i=C$ the parent cycle of\n$i$.\nIn
      any case, let the predecessor of vertex $i$ be either its parent (if\n$f$ is
      a bridge) or the top vertex of $pc_i$ (if $f$ isn''t a bridge.)\nSymmetrically,
      $i$ is a successor of its predecessor.\nAlso, let the subcactus of $i$ be the
      connected subgraph containing $i$\nobtained by deleting $pb_i$ or all edges
      of $pc_i$. Let $T_i$ be the subcactus\nof $i$.\nLet''s observe what edges adjacent
      to vertex $i$ are untraversed when we visit\n$i$ for the first time. Consider
      two cases (recall that $f$ is the edge from $i$\nto its parent):\n\n$f$ is a
      bridge. If $i \\neq 1$, the only way to visit $i$ is through\n$pb_i$. We cannot
      use $pb_i$ twice, so we must stay in $T_i$ from now on.\n\n$f$ is not a bridge.
      We must enter $i$ via one of two adjacent edges in\n$pc_i$. In either case,
      all untraversed edges from $i$ are in $T_i$, except the\nother cycle edge. Indeed,
      this edge is the only edge that can be used to escape\n$T_i$, and once we use
      it, we can never go back to any vertex in $T_i$. We refer\nto this edge as the
      \"escape edge\" of $i$.\n\nThis motivates us to compute the following two DPs:\n$pEscape_i$
      -- the probability that, starting from $i$, we eventually use the\n\"escape
      edge\" from $i$ (For convenience later, let $pEscape_i = 0$ if there is\nno
      such \"escape edge\".)\n$qVisit_{i, j}$ -- the probability that, starting from
      $i$, we visit one of its\nsuccessors $j$.\nIf we have these two DPs, we can
      compute the answer using a DFS from vertex $1$\nas follows.\nSuppose the DFS
      reaches $i$. Let $pVisit_i$ be defined similar to Subtasks 2 and\n3.\nFor a
      successor $j$ of $i$, set $pVisit_j = pVisit_i \\cdot qVisit_{i, j}$, and\nrecurse
      on $j$.\nFinally, let''s compute $ans_i$. You end up at vertex $i$ if you visit
      vertex\n$i$, and you don''t do either of the following:\n\nUse the \"escape
      edge\" from $i$.\n\nEventually reach a successor $j$, and never escape from
      its subcactus.\n\nSince all bad cases above are mutually exclusive, we have\n$$\nans_i
      = pVisit_i \\cdot \\left(1 - pEscape_i - \\sum_{j\\:\\textrm{is a successor
      of}\\:i} qVisit_{i, j} \\left(1 - pEscape_j\\right)\\right)\n$$\nSince each
      vertex has a unique predecessor, the time to compute $ans_i$ from\n$pEscape$
      and $qVisit$ is $O(M)$.\nLet''s compute $pEscape$ and $qVisit$ in a bottom-up
      fashion. Suppose we want to\ncompute them for $i$.\nLet $qEscape_C$ for a cycle
      $C$ with top vertex $i$ be equal to the product of\n$pEscape_j$ for all vertices
      $j \\in C$ excluding $i$. In other words, this is\nthe probability that you
      can complete one traversal of $C$ from $i$ and end up\nback at $i$. \nLet $CC$
      be the set of cycles that $i$ is the top vertex of.\nThere are two things we
      need to calculate:\n$pChoose_{bridge}$ -- The probability of eventually choosing
      a certain bridge\nadjacent to $i$ (or the \"escape edge\" of $i$).\n$pChoose_C$
      -- The probability of eventually choosing one of two edges adjacent\nto $i$
      on a cycle\n$C \\in CC$.\nUsing these, we can compute $pEscape_i$ and $qVisit_{i,
      j}$ as follows:\n\n$qVisit_{i, j}$ on bridges $\\{i, j\\}$ (and $pEscape_i$,
      if there is an \"escape\nedge\") are equal to $pChoose_{bridge}$.\n\nWe are
      left with computing $qVisit_{i, j}$ for all $j$ on a cycle $C \\in CC$.\nAny
      corresponding path must eventually select one of two edges adjacent to $i$\non
      $C$, and traverse the path from $i$ to $j$ along that edge. The probability\nof
      this happening is the product of $pChoose_C$ and $pEscape_{u}$ for all $u$\nalong
      this path. So $qVisit_{i, j}$ can be computed in a similar way as in\nSubtask
      3.\n\nThe next few paragraphs describe how to compute $pChoose_{bridge}$ and\n$pChoose_C$
      for $C \\in CC$ fast.\nLet''s consider $pChoose_{bridge}$. Any corresponding
      path can be described as a\ntraversal of some subset of cycles $C_0, C_1, ...,
      C_{k-1}$, in this order, plus\nthe extra edge.\nSo $pChoose_{bridge}$ is the
      sum of the following over all ordered subsets\n$C_0, C_1, ..., C_{k-1}$:\n$$\n\\left(\\prod_{h=0}^{k-1}
      \\left(1 - p_i\\right) \\cdot \\frac{2}{d_i-2h} \\cdot qEscape_{C_h}\\right)
      \\cdot \\left(1 - p_i\\right) \\cdot \\frac{1}{d_i-2k}\n$$\nAlso, the above
      term doesn''t change if we permute $C_0, C_1, ..., C_{k-1}$, so\nlet''s instead
      sum over all subsets $S \\subseteq CC$:\n$$\npChoose_{bridge} = \\sum_{S \\subseteq
      CC} \\left(k! \\cdot \\left(1 - p_i\\right)^{k+1} \\cdot 2^k \\cdot \\left(\\prod_{h=0}^{k}
      \\frac{1}{d_i-2h}\\right) \\cdot \\prod_{C \\in S} qEscape_{C}\\right)\n$$\n$pChoose_C$
      for $C \\in CC$ can be calculated in the same way, except that in the\nabove
      formula we use $CC \\setminus \\{C\\}$ instead of $CC$.\nCalculating the above
      sums straightforwardly takes $O(2^K \\cdot K^2)$ time, and\nthis passes Subtask
      4 where $K \\le 5$.\nLet''s make it faster. Note that the terms with the same
      $k$ in the above formula\nhave a common factor, namely\n$w_k = k! \\cdot (1
      - p_i)^{k+1} \\cdot 2^k \\cdot (\\prod_{h=0}^{k} \\frac{1}{d_i-2h})$.\nFactoring
      this out, it suffices to compute the sum of\n$\\prod_{C \\in S} qEscape_{C}$
      for all subsets $S \\in CC$ of size $k$.\nWe can do this using generating functions.
      Consider the generating function\n$$\nF(x) = \\prod_{C \\in CC} \\left(1 + qEscape_C
      x\\right)\n$$\nOnce we get this generating function, we add $w_k \\cdot F(x)
      [x^k]$ for all $k$\nto get $pChoose_{bridge}$. We can calculate $pChoose_C$
      for $C \\in CC$\nsimilarly, except that we use $CC \\setminus \\{C\\}$ instead
      of $CC$.\nThe generating function has degree $K$, so multiplying $(1 + qEscape_C
      x)$ takes\n$O(K)$ time. Thus it takes $O(K^2)$ time to calculate $F(x)$, and
      doing this for\nall $O(K)$ probabilities takes $O(K^3)$.\nThe sum of $K$ is
      $O(N)$, so the sum of $K^3$ for the above solution is\n$O(N \\cdot K^2)$. This
      is enough to pass subtask 5, where $K \\le 50$.\nRain''s code for Subtask 5:\n\n#include

      we need to compute $pChoose_{bridge}$ and $pChoose_C$ in\n$O(K^2)$ time.\nNotice
      that the generating function we calculate for $pChoose_C$ is almost the\nsame
      as the one for $pChoose_{bridge}$, but is missing a factor of\n$(1 + qEscape_C
      x)$. This factor can be removed in $O(K)$ time (To divide such a\npolynomial,
      we perform steps backward as when we multiply.)\nIn summary, we spend $O(K)$
      divisions and multiplications, $O(K)$ time for\ncomputing $O(K)$ probabilities
      from the generating function, so in total we\nspend $O(K^2)$ time to compute
      $pChoose_{bridge}$ and $pChoose_C$.\nSumming $K^2$ over all vertices $i$, we
      get a time of $O(N^2)$, which gets full\ncredit.\nA full solution by Rain:\n\n#include

      3: Luxury River Cruise [Josh Alman and Nathan Pinsker, 2013]\n\nFarmer John
      is taking Bessie and the cows on a cruise! They are sailing on a \nnetwork of
      rivers with N ports (1 <= N <= 1,000) labeled 1..N, and Bessie \nstarts at port
      1. Each port has exactly two rivers leading out of it which \nlead directly
      to other ports, and rivers can only be sailed one way.\n\nAt each port, the
      tour guides choose either the \"left\" river or the \"right\" \nriver to sail
      down next, but they keep repeating the same choices over and \nover. More specifically,
      the tour guides have chosen a short sequence of M \ndirections (1 <= M <= 500),
      each either \"left\" or \"right\", and have\nrepeated it K times (1 <= K <=
      1,000,000,000). Bessie thinks she is going\nin circles -- help her figure out
      where she ends up!\n\nPROBLEM NAME: cruise\n\nINPUT FORMAT:\n\n* Line 1: Three
      space-separated integers N, M, and K.\n\n* Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 has two space-separated
      integers,\n        representing the number of the ports that port i''s left
      and\n        right rivers lead to, respectively.\n\n* Line N+2: M space-separated
      characters, either ''L'' or ''R''. ''L''\n        represents a choice of  ''left''
      and ''R'' represents a choice of\n        ''right''.\n\nSAMPLE INPUT:\n\n4 3
      3\n2 4\n3 1\n4 2\n1 3\nL L R\n\nINPUT DETAILS:\n\nThe port numbers are arranged
      clockwise in a circle, with ''L'' being a \nclockwise rotation and ''R'' being
      a counterclockwise rotation. The sequence \ntaken is LLRLLRLLR.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\n\n*
      Line 1: A single integer giving the number of the port where\n        Bessie''s
      cruise ends.\n\nSAMPLE OUTPUT:\n\n4\n\nOUTPUT DETAILS:\n\nAfter the first iteration
      of the sequence of directions, Bessie is at port\n2 (1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 2); after
      the second, she is at port 3 (2 -> 3 -> 4 ->\n3), and at the end she is at port
      4 (3 -> 4 -> 1 -> 4).\n","type":"human","id":"089e388c-20e6-410c-b12e-a3b35b638c58"}}]],"test_cases":"..."},"outputs":{"generations":[[{"text":"<thinking>\nThis
      problem involves simulating movement through a network of ports based on a repeating

      edge to other ports. \n2. A sequence of M left/right directions is given, which
      is repeated K times.\n3. We need to determine the final port after following
      this repeated sequence starting from port 1.\n\nTo solve this, we can:\n1. Read
      in the port graph and store the left/right destinations for each port\n2. Simulate
      the movement:\n   - Maintain a current port\n   - For each direction in the
      sequence:\n     - If ''L'', move to the left port, else move to the right port\n   -

      of repetitions K can be very large (up to 1 billion), so we need to find a way
      to avoid simulating all K repetitions. \n\nOne optimization is to notice that
      if we ever visit the same port twice at the same point in the direction sequence,
      we have entered a cycle. We can fast-forward by calculating how many full cycles
      are left.\n\nSo an optimized approach would be:\n1. Simulate the first M * N

      1. Each port has exactly two rivers leading out of it which \nlead directly
      to other ports, and rivers can only be sailed one way.\n\nAt each port, the
      tour guides choose either the \"left\" river or the \"right\" \nriver to sail
      down next, but they keep repeating the same choices over and \nover. More specifically,
      the tour guides have chosen a short sequence of M \ndirections (1 <= M <= 500),
      each either \"left\" or \"right\", and have\nrepeated it K times (1 <= K <=
      1,000,000,000). Bessie thinks she is going\nin circles -- help her figure out

      problem involves simulating movement through a network of ports based on a repeating
      sequence of left/right directions. The key aspects are:\n1. The network of ports
      is represented as a graph, where each port has a \"left\" and \"right\" outgoing
      edge to other ports. \n2. A sequence of M left/right directions is given, which
      is repeated K times.\n3. We need to determine the final port after following
      this repeated sequence starting from port 1.\n\nTo solve this, we can:\n1. Read
      in the port graph and store the left/right destinations for each port\n2. Simulate
      the movement:\n   - Maintain a current port\n   - For each direction in the
      sequence:\n     - If ''L'', move to the left port, else move to the right port\n   -
      Repeat the sequence K times in total\n3. Output the final port\n\nThe number
      of repetitions K can be very large (up to 1 billion), so we need to find a way
      to avoid simulating all K repetitions. \n\nOne optimization is to notice that
      if we ever visit the same port twice at the same point in the direction sequence,
      we have entered a cycle. We can fast-forward by calculating how many full cycles
      are left.\n\nSo an optimized approach would be:\n1. Simulate the first M * N
      steps, keeping track of the port and position in the sequence for each step\n2.
      If a cycle is detected (same port and sequence position seen before):\n   -
      Calculate remaining number of cycles\n   - Fast-forward to the same point in
      the last cycle\n3. Finish simulating any remaining steps\n4. Output the final
      port\n\nThe time complexity will be O(M * N) and space complexity O(M * N) to

      3: Luxury River Cruise [Josh Alman and Nathan Pinsker, 2013]\n\nFarmer John
      is taking Bessie and the cows on a cruise! They are sailing on a \nnetwork of
      rivers with N ports (1 <= N <= 1,000) labeled 1..N, and Bessie \nstarts at port
      1. Each port has exactly two rivers leading out of it which \nlead directly
      to other ports, and rivers can only be sailed one way.\n\nAt each port, the
      tour guides choose either the \"left\" river or the \"right\" \nriver to sail
      down next, but they keep repeating the same choices over and \nover. More specifically,
      the tour guides have chosen a short sequence of M \ndirections (1 <= M <= 500),
      each either \"left\" or \"right\", and have\nrepeated it K times (1 <= K <=
      1,000,000,000). Bessie thinks she is going\nin circles -- help her figure out
      where she ends up!\n\nPROBLEM NAME: cruise\n\nINPUT FORMAT:\n\n* Line 1: Three

      of the sequence of directions, Bessie is at port\n2 (1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 2); after

      problem involves simulating movement through a network of ports based on a repeating
      sequence of left/right directions. The key aspects are:\n1. The network of ports
      is represented as a graph, where each port has a \"left\" and \"right\" outgoing
      edge to other ports. \n2. A sequence of M left/right directions is given, which
      is repeated K times.\n3. We need to determine the final port after following
      this repeated sequence starting from port 1.\n\nTo solve this, we can:\n1. Read
      in the port graph and store the left/right destinations for each port\n2. Simulate
      the movement:\n   - Maintain a current port\n   - For each direction in the
      sequence:\n     - If ''L'', move to the left port, else move to the right port\n   -
      Repeat the sequence K times in total\n3. Output the final port\n\nThe number
      of repetitions K can be very large (up to 1 billion), so we need to find a way
      to avoid simulating all K repetitions. \n\nOne optimization is to notice that
      if we ever visit the same port twice at the same point in the direction sequence,
      we have entered a cycle. We can fast-forward by calculating how many full cycles
      are left.\n\nSo an optimized approach would be:\n1. Simulate the first M * N
      steps, keeping track of the port and position in the sequence for each step\n2.
      If a cycle is detected (same port and sequence position seen before):\n   -
      Calculate remaining number of cycles\n   - Fast-forward to the same point in
      the last cycle\n3. Finish simulating any remaining steps\n4. Output the final
      port\n\nThe time complexity will be O(M * N) and space complexity O(M * N) to
      store the state at each step for cycle detection.\n</thinking>","type":"text"},{"id":"toolu_01TCbGzzL5B2sa5xFezRTVMJ","input":{"reasoning":"We

      breaking down the algorithm into separate parts: reading inputs, detecting cycles

      Two arrays L and R for the ports (adjust for 0-based indexing)\n    - A third
      array S for the direction sequence\n    \n    Optimize by multiplying K by M
      before the main loop to convert the number of repetitions into the total number
      of steps.\n    \n    Use the tortoise and hare algorithm to detect the cycle:\n    -
      Define a helper function get_next(v) that returns the next position and direction
      index\n    - Initialize two pointers s0 and s1 to (0, 0)\n    - In each iteration:\n      -
      Move s0 by 1 step and s1 by 2 steps using get_next()\n      - If s0 equals s1,
      decrement K by 1 and break out of the loop\n      - Otherwise, decrement K by
      1\n    - After the loop, if K is not 0, there is a cycle\n    \n    To find
      the cycle length:\n    - Initialize a counter variable rho to 1\n    - Move
      s0 by 1 step using get_next()\n    - Enter a loop:\n      - Move s0 by 1 step
      using get_next()\n      - Increment rho\n      - If s0 equals s1, break out
      of the loop\n    \n    Skip ahead by reducing K modulo rho.\n    \n    Simulate
      the remaining steps:\n    - While K > 0, move s0 to the next position using
      get_next() and decrement K\n    \n    Print the final position (converted to
      1-based indexing).\n    \n    Pay close attention to the initialization and

      3: Luxury River Cruise [Josh Alman and Nathan Pinsker, 2013]\n\nFarmer John
      is taking Bessie and the cows on a cruise! They are sailing on a \nnetwork of
      rivers with N ports (1 <= N <= 1,000) labeled 1..N, and Bessie \nstarts at port
      1. Each port has exactly two rivers leading out of it which \nlead directly
      to other ports, and rivers can only be sailed one way.\n\nAt each port, the
      tour guides choose either the \"left\" river or the \"right\" \nriver to sail
      down next, but they keep repeating the same choices over and \nover. More specifically,
      the tour guides have chosen a short sequence of M \ndirections (1 <= M <= 500),
      each either \"left\" or \"right\", and have\nrepeated it K times (1 <= K <=
      1,000,000,000). Bessie thinks she is going\nin circles -- help her figure out
      where she ends up!\n\nPROBLEM NAME: cruise\n\nINPUT FORMAT:\n\n* Line 1: Three
      space-separated integers N, M, and K.\n\n* Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 has two space-separated

      problem involves simulating movement through a network of ports based on a repeating
      sequence of left/right directions. The key aspects are:\n1. The network of ports
      is represented as a graph, where each port has a \"left\" and \"right\" outgoing
      edge to other ports. \n2. A sequence of M left/right directions is given, which
      is repeated K times.\n3. We need to determine the final port after following
      this repeated sequence starting from port 1.\n\nTo solve this, we can:\n1. Read
      in the port graph and store the left/right destinations for each port\n2. Simulate
      the movement:\n   - Maintain a current port\n   - For each direction in the
      sequence:\n     - If ''L'', move to the left port, else move to the right port\n   -
      Repeat the sequence K times in total\n3. Output the final port\n\nThe number
      of repetitions K can be very large (up to 1 billion), so we need to find a way
      to avoid simulating all K repetitions. \n\nOne optimization is to notice that
      if we ever visit the same port twice at the same point in the direction sequence,
      we have entered a cycle. We can fast-forward by calculating how many full cycles
      are left.\n\nSo an optimized approach would be:\n1. Simulate the first M * N
      steps, keeping track of the port and position in the sequence for each step\n2.
      If a cycle is detected (same port and sequence position seen before):\n   -
      Calculate remaining number of cycles\n   - Fast-forward to the same point in
      the last cycle\n3. Finish simulating any remaining steps\n4. Output the final
      port\n\nThe time complexity will be O(M * N) and space complexity O(M * N) to

      by Mythreya Dharani)\nLet''s start by defining a cow as covered if there is
      a patch feeding its\nbreed within a distance of $K$. The problem is asking us
      to cover all cows with\nthe minimum number of patches.\nConsider each cow $i$
      from $1 \\dots N$ in that order, placing patches whenever\nnecessary. First
      of all, if the current cow is already covered,  then we don''t\nneed to place
      another patch, and we can just move on. Otherwise, we need to\nplace a new patch
      for this cow, so where would we place it? Consider what\nhappens if we place
      the patch at position $i + K$. Not only will cow $i$ be\ncovered but any cows
      after it which are within $K$ distance of that patch will\nalso be covered.
      In fact, placing it at this location maximizes the number of\npotential cows
      that can be covered. \nThus, we can just implement this strategy starting at
      cow $1$. Keep in mind that\nif there is a cow $i$ which needs to be fed and
      $i + K > N$, we can just place\nour new patch at position $i$ since all remaining
      same-breed cows can feed off\nthat patch. This solution runs in $O(N)$ time
      since we are just doing a single\npass over the $N$ cows.\nThere is actually
      one edge case; what if when we try to place a patch at\nposition $i$ but there
      is already a patch there? In this case, we can place the\npatch at $i-1$ instead,
      as it may be proven that there can''t already be patches\nat both $i-1$ and
      $i$. As $i-1+K\\ge N$, this patch covers all cows from $i$ to\n$N$ of the same
      breed as cow $i$.\nMythreya Dharani''s C++ code:\n\n#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing

      two islands ($N-1\\le M\\le 3/2(N-1)$). It is guaranteed that the bridges\nform

      of islands, and no bridge connects an island to itself).\n\nIt is also guaranteed
      that no bridge lies on more than one simple cycle. A\nsimple cycle is a cycle

      by Rain Jiang, Benjamin Qi)\nRestating the problem:\nYou are given an undirected
      graph, such that each edge belongs to at most one\nsimple cycle. Such a graph
      is called a\ncactus.\nYou start walking at vertex $1$. Every time you are at
      any vertex $i$, do the\nfollowing:\nWith a probability of $p_i$, end the walk.Otherwise,
      if there are no untraversed edges adjacent to $i$, end the\nwalk.Otherwise,
      choose an untraversed edge adjacent to $i$ uniformly randomly,\nand traverse
      it.\nFor all vertices $i$, you want to find the probability that you end your
      walk at\n$i$. Let''s call this probability $ans_i$.\nLet $d_i$ be $\\deg(i)$
      if $i=1$, and $\\deg(i)-1$ otherwise.\nLet $K$ be the maximum number of cycles
      that any vertex belongs to.\nSubtask 1: $N \\le 11$.\nFrom $N \\le 11$, we can
      see that\n$M \\le \\frac{3}{2} (N - 1) \\le \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot 10 = 15$.\nWith
      these bounds, an $O(2^M \\cdot M)$ DP is sufficient.\nLet $dp_{i, E}$ be the
      probability that you reach a state where you''re at vertex\n$i$, and the set
      of untraversed edges is $E$.\nLet''s see how to transition from $dp_{i, E}$
      to other states.\nLet $E''$ be the set of edges in $E$ adjacent to $i$.\nIf
      $E''$ is empty, we add $dp_{i, E}$ to $ans_i$.\nOtherwise, we add $dp_{i, E}
      \\cdot p_i$ to $ans_i$. Also, for each edge\n$e = \\{i, j\\} \\in E''$ adjacent
      to $i$, we add\n$dp_{i, E} \\cdot (1 - p_i) \\cdot \\frac{1}{|E''|}$ to\n$dp_{j,
      E \\setminus \\{e\\}}$,\nBecause the time spent on transitions from any $dp_{i,
      E}$ is $O(\\deg(i))$, and\nthe sum of $\\deg(i)$ is $O(M)$, the total time taken
      for this DP is\n$O(2^M \\cdot M)$.\nRain''s code:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include

      all\nof Bessie''s possible walks. The number of walks is bounded above by\n$N\\cdot
      3^{(\\#\\text{ simple cycles})}\\cdot \\prod_{1\\le i\\le N}(\\#\\text{ simple
      cycles adjacent to }i)!$\nbecause if we:\nFix Bessie''s ending vertex (choices:
      $N$)For each simple cycle, decide which direction to traverse it in, or not\ntraverse
      it at all (choices: $3^{(\\#\\text{ simple cycles})}$)For each vertex, decide
      in what order we will traverse the simple cycles\nadjacent to it (choices:\n$\\prod_{1\\le
      i\\le N}(\\#\\text{ simple cycles adjacent to }i)!$).\nthen Bessie''s walk is
      uniquely determined. For $N\\le 11$, the number of simple\ncycles is at most  $(N-1)/2\\le
      5$, so the total number of walks cannot be very\nlarge.\nSubtask 3: $K \\le
      1$.\nThe graph is a vertex-disjoint cactus. We need to modify the algorithm
      from\nSubtask 2 to handle cycles.\nAgain, root the cactus at vertex $1$, and
      consider the\nDFS tree of this cactus. Since we\ndid DFS, each cycle can be
      represented as path from a vertex to one of its\ndescendants, plus the corresponding
      back edge. Let''s call this highest vertex\nthe top vertex of the cycle.\nYou
      can see that the path generally moves downward, with occasional roundabouts\nalong
      cycles.\nSimilar to Subtask 2, let $pVisit_i$ be the probability that you reach
      vertex\n$i$ from the root.\nThe transitions using a non-cycle edge can be handled
      similar to Subtask 2.\nLet''s see how to transition using cycle edges. Let $i$
      be the top vertex of\ncycle $C$.\nWe describe how to transition from $i$ to
      another vertex $j$ on cycle $C$. We\ncan see that $pVisit_j$ is the sum of the
      two probabilities of going from $i$ to\n$j$, by choosing one of two paths going
      from $i$ to $j$ along $C$. The\nprobability of traversing one such path is the
      product of $pVisit_i$ and\n$(1 - p_u) \\cdot \\frac{1}{d_u}$ for all vertices
      $u$ along that path.\nYou should also handle the special case of traversing
      the whole cycle $C$ and\nvisiting $i$ a second time. The probability of this
      occurring is similar to the\nabove. After we traverse $C$, there are no more
      cycle edges adjacent to $i$, so\nwe are forced to either stop at $i$ or traverse
      an adjacent non-cycle edge.\nWe can do this using a DFS from vertex $1$. We
      process each cycle $C$ by going\nthrough it twice, once in each direction, taking
      $O(|C|)$ time.\nTime complexity: $O(M)$.\nRain''s code:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include

      5, 6\nAs in earlier subtasks, root the cactus at vertex $1$ and consider the
      DFS tree\nof it.\nHowever, the path is more complex: it can go down the tree
      for quite a while,\nbut eventually retrace and traverse another path.\nLet''s
      define a few terms. Fix vertex $i$. Consider the edge $f$ from $i$ to its\nparent.
      By the assumption that the graph is a cactus, $f$ must either be a\nbridge or
      is\ncontained in a (unique) cycle $C$. (From now on, when we say \"bridge\",
      we mean\nit in the graph theory sense.) If $f$ is a bridge, then call $pb_i=f$
      the\nparent bridge of $i$. Otherwise, call $pc_i=C$ the parent cycle of\n$i$.\nIn
      any case, let the predecessor of vertex $i$ be either its parent (if\n$f$ is
      a bridge) or the top vertex of $pc_i$ (if $f$ isn''t a bridge.)\nSymmetrically,
      $i$ is a successor of its predecessor.\nAlso, let the subcactus of $i$ be the
      connected subgraph containing $i$\nobtained by deleting $pb_i$ or all edges
      of $pc_i$. Let $T_i$ be the subcactus\nof $i$.\nLet''s observe what edges adjacent
      to vertex $i$ are untraversed when we visit\n$i$ for the first time. Consider
      two cases (recall that $f$ is the edge from $i$\nto its parent):\n\n$f$ is a
      bridge. If $i \\neq 1$, the only way to visit $i$ is through\n$pb_i$. We cannot
      use $pb_i$ twice, so we must stay in $T_i$ from now on.\n\n$f$ is not a bridge.
      We must enter $i$ via one of two adjacent edges in\n$pc_i$. In either case,
      all untraversed edges from $i$ are in $T_i$, except the\nother cycle edge. Indeed,
      this edge is the only edge that can be used to escape\n$T_i$, and once we use
      it, we can never go back to any vertex in $T_i$. We refer\nto this edge as the
      \"escape edge\" of $i$.\n\nThis motivates us to compute the following two DPs:\n$pEscape_i$
      -- the probability that, starting from $i$, we eventually use the\n\"escape
      edge\" from $i$ (For convenience later, let $pEscape_i = 0$ if there is\nno
      such \"escape edge\".)\n$qVisit_{i, j}$ -- the probability that, starting from
      $i$, we visit one of its\nsuccessors $j$.\nIf we have these two DPs, we can
      compute the answer using a DFS from vertex $1$\nas follows.\nSuppose the DFS
      reaches $i$. Let $pVisit_i$ be defined similar to Subtasks 2 and\n3.\nFor a
      successor $j$ of $i$, set $pVisit_j = pVisit_i \\cdot qVisit_{i, j}$, and\nrecurse
      on $j$.\nFinally, let''s compute $ans_i$. You end up at vertex $i$ if you visit
      vertex\n$i$, and you don''t do either of the following:\n\nUse the \"escape
      edge\" from $i$.\n\nEventually reach a successor $j$, and never escape from
      its subcactus.\n\nSince all bad cases above are mutually exclusive, we have\n$$\nans_i
      = pVisit_i \\cdot \\left(1 - pEscape_i - \\sum_{j\\:\\textrm{is a successor
      of}\\:i} qVisit_{i, j} \\left(1 - pEscape_j\\right)\\right)\n$$\nSince each
      vertex has a unique predecessor, the time to compute $ans_i$ from\n$pEscape$
      and $qVisit$ is $O(M)$.\nLet''s compute $pEscape$ and $qVisit$ in a bottom-up
      fashion. Suppose we want to\ncompute them for $i$.\nLet $qEscape_C$ for a cycle
      $C$ with top vertex $i$ be equal to the product of\n$pEscape_j$ for all vertices
      $j \\in C$ excluding $i$. In other words, this is\nthe probability that you
      can complete one traversal of $C$ from $i$ and end up\nback at $i$. \nLet $CC$
      be the set of cycles that $i$ is the top vertex of.\nThere are two things we
      need to calculate:\n$pChoose_{bridge}$ -- The probability of eventually choosing
      a certain bridge\nadjacent to $i$ (or the \"escape edge\" of $i$).\n$pChoose_C$
      -- The probability of eventually choosing one of two edges adjacent\nto $i$
      on a cycle\n$C \\in CC$.\nUsing these, we can compute $pEscape_i$ and $qVisit_{i,
      j}$ as follows:\n\n$qVisit_{i, j}$ on bridges $\\{i, j\\}$ (and $pEscape_i$,
      if there is an \"escape\nedge\") are equal to $pChoose_{bridge}$.\n\nWe are
      left with computing $qVisit_{i, j}$ for all $j$ on a cycle $C \\in CC$.\nAny
      corresponding path must eventually select one of two edges adjacent to $i$\non
      $C$, and traverse the path from $i$ to $j$ along that edge. The probability\nof
      this happening is the product of $pChoose_C$ and $pEscape_{u}$ for all $u$\nalong
      this path. So $qVisit_{i, j}$ can be computed in a similar way as in\nSubtask
      3.\n\nThe next few paragraphs describe how to compute $pChoose_{bridge}$ and\n$pChoose_C$
      for $C \\in CC$ fast.\nLet''s consider $pChoose_{bridge}$. Any corresponding
      path can be described as a\ntraversal of some subset of cycles $C_0, C_1, ...,
      C_{k-1}$, in this order, plus\nthe extra edge.\nSo $pChoose_{bridge}$ is the
      sum of the following over all ordered subsets\n$C_0, C_1, ..., C_{k-1}$:\n$$\n\\left(\\prod_{h=0}^{k-1}
      \\left(1 - p_i\\right) \\cdot \\frac{2}{d_i-2h} \\cdot qEscape_{C_h}\\right)
      \\cdot \\left(1 - p_i\\right) \\cdot \\frac{1}{d_i-2k}\n$$\nAlso, the above
      term doesn''t change if we permute $C_0, C_1, ..., C_{k-1}$, so\nlet''s instead
      sum over all subsets $S \\subseteq CC$:\n$$\npChoose_{bridge} = \\sum_{S \\subseteq
      CC} \\left(k! \\cdot \\left(1 - p_i\\right)^{k+1} \\cdot 2^k \\cdot \\left(\\prod_{h=0}^{k}
      \\frac{1}{d_i-2h}\\right) \\cdot \\prod_{C \\in S} qEscape_{C}\\right)\n$$\n$pChoose_C$
      for $C \\in CC$ can be calculated in the same way, except that in the\nabove
      formula we use $CC \\setminus \\{C\\}$ instead of $CC$.\nCalculating the above
      sums straightforwardly takes $O(2^K \\cdot K^2)$ time, and\nthis passes Subtask
      4 where $K \\le 5$.\nLet''s make it faster. Note that the terms with the same
      $k$ in the above formula\nhave a common factor, namely\n$w_k = k! \\cdot (1
      - p_i)^{k+1} \\cdot 2^k \\cdot (\\prod_{h=0}^{k} \\frac{1}{d_i-2h})$.\nFactoring
      this out, it suffices to compute the sum of\n$\\prod_{C \\in S} qEscape_{C}$
      for all subsets $S \\in CC$ of size $k$.\nWe can do this using generating functions.
      Consider the generating function\n$$\nF(x) = \\prod_{C \\in CC} \\left(1 + qEscape_C
      x\\right)\n$$\nOnce we get this generating function, we add $w_k \\cdot F(x)
      [x^k]$ for all $k$\nto get $pChoose_{bridge}$. We can calculate $pChoose_C$
      for $C \\in CC$\nsimilarly, except that we use $CC \\setminus \\{C\\}$ instead
      of $CC$.\nThe generating function has degree $K$, so multiplying $(1 + qEscape_C
      x)$ takes\n$O(K)$ time. Thus it takes $O(K^2)$ time to calculate $F(x)$, and
      doing this for\nall $O(K)$ probabilities takes $O(K^3)$.\nThe sum of $K$ is
      $O(N)$, so the sum of $K^3$ for the above solution is\n$O(N \\cdot K^2)$. This
      is enough to pass subtask 5, where $K \\le 50$.\nRain''s code for Subtask 5:\n\n#include

      we need to compute $pChoose_{bridge}$ and $pChoose_C$ in\n$O(K^2)$ time.\nNotice
      that the generating function we calculate for $pChoose_C$ is almost the\nsame
      as the one for $pChoose_{bridge}$, but is missing a factor of\n$(1 + qEscape_C
