# Runs

A run is an invocation of an [assistant](../../concepts/assistants.md). Each run may have its own input, configuration, and metadata, which may affect execution and output of the underlying graph. A run can optionally be executed on a [thread](./threads.md).

The LangGraph Cloud API provides several endpoints for creating and managing runs. See the [API reference](../../cloud/reference/api/api_ref.html#tag/thread-runs/) for more details.
