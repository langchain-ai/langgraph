# LangGraph Studio With Local Deployment

!!! warning "Browser Compatibility"
    Viewing the studio page of a local LangGraph deployment does not work in Safari. Use Chrome instead.

## Setup

Make sure you have setup your app correctly, by creating a compiled graph, a `.env` file with any environment variables, and a `langgraph.json` config file that points to your environment file and compiled graph. See [here](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/cloud/deployment/setup/) for more detailed instructions.

After you have your app setup, head into the directory with your `langgraph.json` file and call `langgraph dev` to start the API server in watch mode which means it will restart on code changes, which is ideal for local testing. If the API server start correctly you should see logs that look something like this:

>    Ready!
> 
>    - API: [http://localhost:2024](http://localhost:2024/)
>     
>    - Docs: http://localhost:2024/docs
>     
>    - LangGraph Studio Web UI: https://smith.langchain.com/studio/?baseUrl=http://127.0.0.1:2024

Read this [reference](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/cloud/reference/cli/#up) to learn about all the options for starting the API server.

## Access Studio

Once you have successfully started the API server, you can access the studio by going to the following URL: `https://smith.langchain.com/studio/?baseUrl=http://127.0.0.1:2024` (see warning above if using Safari).

If everything is working correctly you should see the studio show up looking something like this (with your graph diagram on the left hand side):
