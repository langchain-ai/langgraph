# Quickstart: Deploy on LangGraph Cloud

!!! note "Prerequisites"

    Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

    - [GitHub account](https://github.com/)
    - [LangSmith account](https://smith.langchain.com/)

## Create a repository on GitHub

To deploy a LangGraph application to **LangGraph Cloud**, your application code must reside in a GitHub repository. Both public and private repositories are supported.

You can deploy any [LangGraph Application](../concepts/application_structure.md) to LangGraph Cloud.

For this guide, we'll use the pre-built Python [**ReAct Agent**](https://github.com/langchain-ai/react-agent) template.

??? note "Get Required API Keys for the ReAct Agent template"

    This **ReAct Agent** application requires an API key from [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com/) and [Tavily](https://app.tavily.com/). You can get these API keys by signing up on their respective websites.

    **Alternative**: If you'd prefer a scaffold application that doesn't require API keys, use the [**New LangGraph Project**](https://github.com/langchain-ai/new-langgraph-project) template instead of the **ReAct Agent** template.


1. Go to the [ReAct Agent](https://github.com/langchain-ai/react-agent) repository.
2. Fork the repository to your GitHub account by clicking the `Fork` button in the top right corner.

## Deploy to LangGraph Cloud

    <figcaption>
    Click on **+ New Deployment** to create a new deployment. This button is located in the top right corner.
    It'll open a new modal where you can fill out the required fields.
    </figcaption>
    </figure>

??? note "4. Click on Import from GitHub (first time users)"

    <figure markdown="1">

    <figcaption>
    Click on **Import from GitHub** and follow the instructions to connect your GitHub account. This step is needed for **first-time users** or to add private repositories that haven't been connected before.</figcaption>
        </figure>

??? note "5. Select the repository, configure ENV vars etc"

    <figure markdown="1">
    [![image](deployment/img/05_configure_deployment.png){: style="max-height:300px"}](deployment/img/05_configure_deployment.png)
    <figcaption>
    Select the <strong>repository</strong>, add env variables and secrets, and set other configuration options.
    </figcaption>
    </figure>

    - **Repository**: Select the repository you forked earlier (or any other repository you want to deploy).
    - Set the secrets and environment variables required by your application. For the **ReAct Agent** template, you need to set the following secrets:
        - **ANTHROPIC_API_KEY**: Get an API key from [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com/).
        - **TAVILY_API_KEY**: Get an API key on the [Tavily website](https://app.tavily.com/).

??? note "6. Click Submit to Deploy!"

## Test the API

!!! note

    The API calls below are for the **ReAct Agent** template. If you're deploying a different application, you may need to adjust the API calls accordingly.

Before using, you need to get the `URL` of your LangGraph deployment. You can find this in the `Deployment` view. Click the `URL` to copy it to the clipboard.

You also need to make sure you have set up your API key properly, so you can authenticate with LangGraph Cloud.

```shell
export LANGSMITH_API_KEY=...
```

=== "Python SDK (Async)"

    **Install the LangGraph Python SDK**

    ```shell
