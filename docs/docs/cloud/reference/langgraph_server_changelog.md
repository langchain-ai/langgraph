- Improved performance by setting thread and run status in a single query and enhanced error handling during checkpoint writes.
- Reduced the default background grace period to 3 minutes.

## v0.2.52 (2025-06-12)
- Now logging expected graphs when one is omitted to improve traceability.

## v0.2.51 (2025-06-12)
- Handled `CancelledError` by marking tasks as ready to retry, improving error management in worker processes.
- Added LG API version and request ID to metadata and logs for better tracking.
- Added LG API version and request ID to metadata and logs to improve traceability.
- Improved database performance by creating indexes concurrently.
- Ensured postgres write is committed only after the Redis running marker is set to prevent race conditions.
- Enhanced query efficiency and reliability by adding a unique index on thread_id/running, optimizing row locks, and ensuring deterministic run selection.
- Resolved a race condition by ensuring Postgres updates only occur after the Redis running marker is set.

## v0.2.46 (2025-06-07)
- Introduced a new connection for each operation while preserving transaction characteristics in Threads state `update()` and `bulk()` commands.

## v0.2.45 (2025-06-05)
- Enhanced streaming feature by incorporating tracing contexts.
- Removed an unnecessary query from the Crons.search function.
- Resolved connection reuse issue when scheduling next run for multiple cron jobs.
- Removed an unnecessary query in the Crons.search function to improve efficiency.
- Resolved an issue with scheduling the next cron run by improving connection reuse.

## v0.2.44 (2025-06-04)
- Enhanced the worker logic to exit the pipeline before continuing when the Redis message limit is reached.
- Introduced a ceiling for Redis message size with an option to skip messages larger than 128 MB for improved performance.

## v0.2.43 (2025-06-04)
- Improved performance by omitting logs in metadata calls and ensuring output schema compliance in value streaming.
- Ensured the connection is properly closed after use.
