### Run your server locally

First, make sure that docker is up and running. Test that your server works by running:

```python
langgraph up -c langgraph.json
```

This will bring up a local server with your graph! Access the auto-generated server for your playground to confirm everything works as planned at [http://localhost:8124](http://localhost:8124) .
