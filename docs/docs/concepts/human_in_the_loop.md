# Human-in-the-loop

LangGraph supports robust **human-in-the-loop (HIL)** workflows, enabling human intervention at any point in an automated process. This is especially useful in large language model (LLM)-driven applications where model output may require validation, correction, or additional context.

## Key capabilities

* **Persistent execution state**: LangGraph checkpoints the graph state after each step, allowing execution to pause indefinitely at defined nodes. This supports asynchronous human review or input without time constraints.

* **Flexible integration points**: HIL logic can be introduced at any point in the workflow. This allows targeted human involvement, such as approving API calls, correcting outputs, or guiding conversations.

## Typical use cases

1. [**üõ†Ô∏è Reviewing tool calls**](../how-tos/human_in_the_loop/add-human-in-the-loop.md#review-tool-calls): Humans can review, edit, or approve tool calls requested by the LLM before tool execution.
2. **‚úÖ Validating LLM outputs**: Humans can review, edit, or approve content generated by the LLM.
3. **üí° Providing context**: Enable the LLM to explicitly request human input for clarification or additional details or to support multi-turn conversations.

## Implementation

* `interrupt` function: Pauses execution at a specific point, presents information for human review.
* `Command` primitive: Used to resume execution with a value provided by the human.
