# Self-Hosted Data Plane

There are two versions of the self-hosted deployment: [Self-Hosted Data Plane](./deployment_options.md#self-hosted-data-plane) and [Self-Hosted Control Plane](./deployment_options.md#self-hosted-control-plane).

## Requirements

- You use `langgraph-cli` and/or [LangGraph Studio](./langgraph_studio.md) app to test graph locally.
- You use `langgraph build` command to build image.

## Self-Hosted Data Plane (Beta)

The [Self-Hosted Data Plane](./self_hosted.md.md) deployment option is a "hybrid" model for deployment where we manage the [control plane](./langgraph_control_plane.md) in our cloud and you manage the [data plane](./langgraph_data_plane.md) in your cloud. This option provides a way to securely manage your data plane infrastructure, while offloading control plane management to us. When using the Self-Hosted Data Plane version, you authenticate with a [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/) API key.

| **What is it?** | <ul><li>Control plane UI for creating deployments and revisions</li><li>Control plane APIs for creating deployments and revisions</li></ul> | <ul><li>Data plane "listener" for reconciling deployments with control plane state</li><li>LangGraph Servers</li><li>Postgres, Redis, etc</li></ul> |
| **Where is it hosted?** | LangChain's cloud | Your cloud |
| **Who provisions and manages it?** | LangChain | You |

For information on how to deploy a [LangGraph Server](../concepts/langgraph_server.md) to Self-Hosted Data Plane, see [Deploy to Self-Hosted Data Plane](../cloud/deployment/self_hosted_data_plane.md)

### Compute Platforms

- **Kubernetes**: The Self-Hosted Data Plane deployment option supports deploying data plane infrastructure to any Kubernetes cluster.
- **Amazon ECS**: Coming soon!

!!! tip
    If you would like to deploy to Kubernetes, you can use this [Helm chart](https://github.com/langchain-ai/helm/blob/main/charts/langgraph-cloud/README.md).
