## ðŸŒ± Create a LangGraph App

To create a new app from a template, use the `langgraph new` command.

```bash
langgraph new
```

## Next Steps

Review the `README.md` file in the root of your new LangGraph app for more information about the template and how to customize it.

After configuring the app properly and adding your API keys, you can start the app using the LangGraph CLI:

```bash
langgraph dev 
```

See the following guides for more information on how to deploy your app:
