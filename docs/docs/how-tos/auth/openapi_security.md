# How to document API authentication in OpenAPI

This guide shows how to customize the OpenAPI security schema for your LangGraph Platform API documentation. A well-documented security schema helps API consumers understand how to authenticate with your API and even enables automatic client generation. See the [Authentication & Access Control conceptual guide](../../concepts/auth.md) for more details about LangGraph's authentication system.

!!! note "Implementation vs Documentation"
    This guide only covers how to document your security requirements in OpenAPI. To implement the actual authentication logic, see [How to add custom authentication](./custom_auth.md).

This guide applies to all LangGraph Platform deployments (Cloud and self-hosted). It does not apply to usage of the LangGraph open source library if you are not using LangGraph Platform.

## Default Schema

The default security scheme varies by deployment type:

=== "LangGraph Cloud"

By default, LangGraph Cloud requires a LangSmith API key in the `x-api-key` header:

```yaml
components:
  securitySchemes:
    apiKeyAuth:
      type: apiKey
      in: header
      name: x-api-key
security:
  - apiKeyAuth: []
```

When using one of the LangGraph SDK's, this can be inferred from environment variables.

=== "Self-hosted"

By default, self-hosted deployments have no security scheme. This means they are to be deployed only on a secured network or with authentication. To add custom authentication, see [How to add custom authentication](./custom_auth.md).

## Custom Security Schema

To customize the security schema in your OpenAPI documentation, add an `openapi` field to your `auth` configuration in `langgraph.json`. Remember that this only updates the API documentation - you must also implement the corresponding authentication logic as shown in [How to add custom authentication](./custom_auth.md).

Note that LangGraph Platform does not provide authentication endpoints - you'll need to handle user authentication in your client application and pass the resulting credentials to the LangGraph API.

=== "OAuth2 with Bearer Token"

    ```json
    {
      "auth": {
        "path": "./auth.py:my_auth",  // Implement auth logic here
        "openapi": {
          "securitySchemes": {
            "OAuth2": {
              "type": "oauth2",
              "flows": {
                "implicit": {
                  "authorizationUrl": "https://your-auth-server.com/oauth/authorize",
                  "scopes": {
                    "me": "Read information about the current user",
                    "threads": "Access to create and manage threads"
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          },
          "security": [
            {"OAuth2": ["me", "threads"]}
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    ```

=== "API Key"

    ```json
    {
      "auth": {
        "path": "./auth.py:my_auth",  // Implement auth logic here
        "openapi": {
          "securitySchemes": {
            "apiKeyAuth": {
              "type": "apiKey",
              "in": "header",
              "name": "X-API-Key"
            }
          },
          "security": [
            {"apiKeyAuth": []}
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    ```

## Testing

After updating your configuration:

1. Deploy your application
2. Visit `/docs` to see the updated OpenAPI documentation
3. Try out the endpoints using credentials from your authentication server (make sure you've implemented the authentication logic first)
