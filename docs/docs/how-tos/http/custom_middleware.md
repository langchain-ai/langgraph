# How to add custom middleware

When deploying agents on the LangGraph platform, you can add custom middleware to your server to handle cross-cutting concerns like logging request metrics, injecting or checking headers, and enforcing security policies without modifying core server logic. This works the same way as [adding custom routes](./custom_routes.md) - you just need to provide your own [`Starlette`](https://www.starlette.io/applications/) app (including [`FastAPI`](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), [`FastHTML`](https://fastht.ml/) and other compatible apps).

Adding middleware lets you intercept and modify requests and responses globally across your deployment, whether they're hitting your custom endpoints or the built-in LangGraph Platform APIs.

Below is an example using FastAPI.

???+ note "Python only"

    We currently only support custom middleware in Python deployments with `langgraph-api>=0.0.26`.

## Create app

Starting from an **existing** LangGraph Platform application, add the following middleware code to your `webapp.py` file. If you are starting from scratch, you can create a new app from a template using the CLI.

```bash
langgraph new --template=new-langgraph-project-python my_new_project
```

Once you have a LangGraph project, add the following app code:

```python
# ./src/agent/webapp.py
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request
from starlette.middleware.base import BaseHTTPMiddleware

# highlight-next-line
app = FastAPI()

class CustomHeaderMiddleware(BaseHTTPMiddleware):
    async def dispatch(self, request: Request, call_next):
        response = await call_next(request)
        response.headers['X-Custom-Header'] = 'Hello from middleware!'
        return response

# Add the middleware to the app
app.add_middleware(CustomHeaderMiddleware)
```

## Configure `langgraph.json`

Add the following to your `langgraph.json` file. Make sure the path points to the `webapp.py` file you created above.

```json
{
  "dependencies": ["."],
  "graphs": {
    "agent": "./src/agent/graph.py:graph"
  },
  "env": ".env",
  "http": {
    "app": "./src/agent/webapp.py:app"
  }
  // Other configuration options like auth, store, etc.
}
```

## Start server

Test the server out locally:

```bash
langgraph dev --no-browser
```

Now any request to your server will include the custom header `X-Custom-Header` in its response.

## Deploying

You can deploy this app as-is to the managed langgraph cloud or to your self-hosted platform.

## Next steps

Now that you've added custom middleware to your deployment, you can use similar techniques to add [custom routes](./custom_routes.md) or define [custom lifespan events](./custom_lifespan.md) to further customize your server's behavior.
