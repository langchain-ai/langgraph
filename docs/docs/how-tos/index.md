# How-to Guides

Here you’ll find answers to “How do I...?” types of questions. These guides are **goal-oriented** and concrete; they're meant to help you complete a specific task. For conceptual explanations see the [Conceptual guide](../concepts/index.md). For end-to-end walk-throughs see [Tutorials](../tutorials/index.md). For comprehensive descriptions of every class and function see the [API Reference](../reference/index.md).

## LangGraph

### Graph API Basics

- [How to update graph state from nodes](state-reducers.ipynb)
- [How to create a sequence of steps](sequence.ipynb)
- [How to create branches for parallel execution](branching.ipynb)
- [How to create and control loops with recursion limits](recursion-limit.ipynb)
- [How to visualize your graph](visualization.ipynb)

### Fine-grained Control

These guides demonstrate LangGraph features that grant fine-grained control over the
execution of your graph.

- [How to create map-reduce branches for parallel execution](map-reduce.ipynb)

- [How to return state before hitting recursion limit](return-when-recursion-limit-hits.ipynb)

### Persistence

[LangGraph Persistence](../concepts/persistence.md) makes it easy to persist state across graph runs (per-thread persistence) and across threads (cross-thread persistence). These how-to guides show how to add persistence to your graph.

- [How to add thread-level persistence to your graph](persistence.ipynb)
- [How to add thread-level persistence to a subgraph](subgraph-persistence.ipynb)
- [How to add cross-thread persistence to your graph](cross-thread-persistence.ipynb)
- [How to use Postgres checkpointer for persistence](persistence_postgres.ipynb)
- [How to use MongoDB checkpointer for persistence](persistence_mongodb.ipynb)
- [How to create a custom checkpointer using Redis](persistence_redis.ipynb)

See the below guides for how-to add persistence to your workflow using the [Functional API](../concepts/functional_api.md):

- [How to add thread-level persistence (functional API)](persistence-functional.ipynb)
- [How to add cross-thread persistence (functional API)](cross-thread-persistence-functional.ipynb)

### Memory

LangGraph makes it easy to manage conversation [memory](../concepts/memory.md) in your graph. These how-to guides show how to implement different strategies for that.

- [How to manage conversation history](memory/manage-conversation-history.ipynb)
- [How to delete messages](memory/delete-messages.ipynb)
- [How to add summary conversation memory](memory/add-summary-conversation-history.ipynb)
- [How to add long-term memory (cross-thread)](cross-thread-persistence.ipynb)
- [How to use semantic search for long-term memory](memory/semantic-search.ipynb)

### Human-in-the-loop

[Human-in-the-loop](../concepts/human_in_the_loop.md) functionality allows
you to involve humans in the decision-making process of your graph. These how-to guides show how to implement human-in-the-loop workflows in your graph.

Key workflows:

- [How to wait for user input](human_in_the_loop/wait-user-input.ipynb): A basic example that shows how to implement a human-in-the-loop workflow in your graph using the `interrupt` function.
- [How to review tool calls](human_in_the_loop/review-tool-calls.ipynb): Incorporate human-in-the-loop for reviewing/editing/accepting tool call requests before they executed using the `interrupt` function.

Other methods:

- [How to add static breakpoints](human_in_the_loop/breakpoints.ipynb): Use for debugging purposes. For [**human-in-the-loop**](../concepts/human_in_the_loop.md) workflows, we recommend the [`interrupt` function][langgraph.types.interrupt] instead.
- [How to edit graph state](human_in_the_loop/edit-graph-state.ipynb): Edit graph state using `graph.update_state` method. Use this if implementing a **human-in-the-loop** workflow via **static breakpoints**.
- [How to add dynamic breakpoints with `NodeInterrupt`](human_in_the_loop/dynamic_breakpoints.ipynb): **Not recommended**: Use the [`interrupt` function](../concepts/human_in_the_loop.md) instead.

See the below guides for how-to implement human-in-the-loop workflows with the
[Functional API](../concepts/functional_api.md):

- [How to wait for user input (Functional API)](wait-user-input-functional.ipynb)
- [How to review tool calls (Functional API)](review-tool-calls-functional.ipynb)

### Time Travel

[Time travel](../concepts/time-travel.md) allows you to replay past actions in your LangGraph application to explore alternative paths and debug issues. These how-to guides show how to use time travel in your graph.

- [How to view and update past graph state](human_in_the_loop/time-travel.ipynb)

### Streaming

[Streaming](../concepts/streaming.md) is crucial for enhancing the responsiveness of applications built on LLMs. By displaying output progressively, even before a complete response is ready, streaming significantly improves user experience (UX), particularly when dealing with the latency of LLMs.

- [How to stream](streaming.ipynb)
- [How to stream LLM tokens](streaming-tokens.ipynb)
- [How to stream LLM tokens from specific nodes](streaming-specific-nodes.ipynb)
- [How to stream data from within a tool](streaming-events-from-within-tools.ipynb)
- [How to stream from subgraphs](streaming-subgraphs.ipynb)
- [How to disable streaming for models that don't support it](disable-streaming.ipynb)

### Tool calling

[Tool calling](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/tool_calling/) is a type of
[chat model](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/chat_models/) API that accepts
tool schemas, along with messages, as input and returns invocations of those tools as
part of the output message.

These how-to guides show common patterns for tool calling with LangGraph:

- [How to call tools using ToolNode](tool-calling.ipynb)
- [How to handle tool calling errors](tool-calling-errors.ipynb)

- [How to pass config to tools](pass-config-to-tools.ipynb)
- [How to update graph state from tools](update-state-from-tools.ipynb)
- [How to handle large numbers of tools](many-tools.ipynb)

### Subgraphs

[Subgraphs](../concepts/low_level.md#subgraphs) allow you to reuse an existing graph from another graph. These how-to guides show how to use subgraphs:

- [How to use subgraphs](subgraph.ipynb)
- [How to view and update state in subgraphs](subgraphs-manage-state.ipynb)
- [How to transform inputs and outputs of a subgraph](subgraph-transform-state.ipynb)

### Multi-agent

[Multi-agent systems](../concepts/multi_agent.md) are useful to break down complex LLM applications into multiple agents, each responsible for a different part of the application. These how-to guides show how to implement multi-agent systems in LangGraph:

- [How to implement handoffs between agents](agent-handoffs.ipynb)
- [How to build a multi-agent network](multi-agent-network.ipynb)
- [How to add multi-turn conversation in a multi-agent application](multi-agent-multi-turn-convo.ipynb)

See the [multi-agent tutorials](../tutorials/index.md#multi-agent-systems) for implementations of other multi-agent architectures.

See the below guides for how to implement multi-agent workflows with the [Functional API](../concepts/functional_api.md):

- [How to build a multi-agent network (functional API)](multi-agent-network-functional.ipynb)
- [How to add multi-turn conversation in a multi-agent application (functional API)](multi-agent-multi-turn-convo-functional.ipynb)

### State Management

- [How to use Pydantic model as graph state](state-model.ipynb)
- [How to define input/output schema for your graph](input_output_schema.ipynb)
- [How to pass private state between nodes inside the graph](pass_private_state.ipynb)

### Other

### Prebuilt ReAct Agent

The LangGraph [prebuilt ReAct agent](../reference/prebuilt.md#langgraph.prebuilt.chat_agent_executor.create_react_agent) is pre-built implementation of a [tool calling agent](../concepts/agentic_concepts.md#tool-calling-agent).

One of the big benefits of LangGraph is that you can easily create your own agent architectures. So while it's fine to start here to build an agent quickly, we would strongly recommend learning how to build your own agent so that you can take full advantage of LangGraph.

These guides show how to use the prebuilt ReAct agent:

- [How to use the pre-built ReAct agent](create-react-agent.ipynb)
- [How to add thread-level memory to a ReAct Agent](create-react-agent-memory.ipynb)
- [How to add a custom system prompt to a ReAct agent](create-react-agent-system-prompt.ipynb)
- [How to add human-in-the-loop processes to a ReAct agent](create-react-agent-hitl.ipynb)
- [How to return structured output from a ReAct agent](create-react-agent-structured-output.ipynb)
- [How to add semantic search for long-term memory to a ReAct agent](memory/semantic-search.ipynb#using-in-create-react-agent)

Interested in further customizing the ReAct agent? This guide provides an
overview of its underlying implementation to help you customize for your own needs:

- [How to create prebuilt ReAct agent from scratch](react-agent-from-scratch.ipynb)

See the below guide for how-to build ReAct agents with the [Functional API](../concepts/functional_api.md):

- [How to create a ReAct agent from scratch (Functional API)](react-agent-from-scratch-functional.ipynb)

## LangGraph Platform

This section includes how-to guides for LangGraph Platform.

LangGraph Platform is a commercial solution for deploying agentic applications in production, built on the open-source LangGraph framework.

- [How to implement Generative User Interfaces with LangGraph](../cloud/how-tos/generative_ui_react.md)

### Human-in-the-loop

When designing complex graphs, relying entirely on the LLM for decision-making can be risky, particularly when it involves tools that interact with files, APIs, or databases. These interactions may lead to unintended data access or modifications, depending on the use case. To mitigate these risks, LangGraph allows you to integrate human-in-the-loop behavior, ensuring your LLM applications operate as intended without undesirable outcomes.

- [How to review tool calls](../cloud/how-tos/human_in_the_loop_review_tool_calls.md)

### Double-texting

Graph execution can take a while, and sometimes users may change their mind about the input they wanted to send before their original input has finished running. For example, a user might notice a typo in their original request and will edit the prompt and resend it. Deciding what to do in these cases is important for ensuring a smooth user experience and preventing your graphs from behaving in unexpected ways.
