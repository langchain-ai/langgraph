# How to connect a local agent to LangGraph Studio

This guide shows you how to connect your local agent to [LangGraph Studio](../concepts/langgraph_studio.md) for visualization, interaction, and debugging using the development server.

## Setup your application

First, you will need to setup your application in the proper format.
This means defining a `langgraph.json` file which contains paths to your agent(s).
See [this guide](../concepts/application_structure.md) for information on how to do so.

## Install langgraph-cli

You will need to install [`langgraph-cli`](../cloud/reference/cli.md#langgraph-cli) (version `0.1.55` or higher).
You will need to make sure to install the `inmem` extras.

???+ note "Minimum version"

The minimum version to use the `inmem` extra with `langgraph-cli` is `0.1.55`.
Python 3.11 or higher is required.

```shell
pip install -U "langgraph-cli[inmem]"
```

## Run the development server

1. Navigate to your project directory (where `langgraph.json` is located)

2. Start the server:
   ```bash
   langgraph dev
   ```

This will look for the `langgraph.json` file in your current directory.
In there, it will find the paths to the graph(s), and start those up.
It will then automatically connect to the cloud-hosted studio.

## Use the studio

After connecting to the studio, a browser window should automatically pop up.
This will use the cloud hosted studio UI to connect to your local development server.
Your graph is still running locally, the UI is connecting to visualizing the agent and threads that are defined locally.

The graph will always use the most up-to-date code, so you will be able to change the underlying code and have it automatically reflected in the studio.
This is useful for debugging workflows.
You can run your graph in the UI until it messes up, go in and change your code, and then rerun from the node that failed.

# (Optional) Attach a debugger

For step-by-step debugging with breakpoints and variable inspection:

```bash
# Install debugpy package
pip install debugpy

# Start server with debugging enabled
langgraph dev --debug-port 5678
```

Then attach your preferred debugger:

=== "VS Code"
    Add this configuration to `launch.json`:
    ```json
    {
      "name": "Attach to LangGraph",
      "type": "debugpy",
      "request": "attach",
      "connect": {
        "host": "0.0.0.0",
        "port": 5678
      }
    }
    ```
    Specify the port number you chose in the previous step.

=== "PyCharm"
    1. Go to Run â†’ Edit Configurations
    2. Click + and select "Python Debug Server"
    3. Set IDE host name: `localhost`
    4. Set port: `5678` (or the port number you chose in the previous step)
    5. Click "OK" and start debugging
