    "# How to manage conversation history\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most common use cases for persistence is to use it to keep track of conversation history. This is great - it makes it easy to continue conversations. As conversations get longer and longer, however, this conversation history can build up and take up more and more of the context window. This can often be undesirable as it leads to more expensive and longer calls to the LLM, and potentially ones that error. In order to prevent this from happening, you need to properly manage the conversation history.\n",
