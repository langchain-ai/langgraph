# LLMs-txt Overview

## Overview

Below you can find a list of documentation files in the [`llms.txt`](https://llmstxt.org/) format, specifically `llms.txt` and `llms-full.txt`. These files allow large language models (LLMs) and agents to access programming documentation and APIs, particularly useful within integrated development environments (IDEs).

!!! info "Review the output"

    Even with access to up-to-date documentation, current state-of-the-art models may not always generate correct code. Treat the generated code as a starting point, and always review it before shipping
    code to production.

## Differences Between `llms.txt` and `llms-full.txt`

- **`llms.txt`** is an index file containing links with brief descriptions of the content. An LLM or agent must follow these links to access detailed information.

- **`llms-full.txt`** includes all the detailed content directly in a single file, eliminating the need for additional navigation.

A key consideration when using `llms-full.txt` is its size. For extensive documentation, this file may become too large to fit into an LLM's context window.

## Using `llms.txt` via an MCP Server

As of March 9, 2025, IDEs [do not yet have robust native support for `llms.txt`](https://x.com/jeremyphoward/status/1902109312216129905?t=1eHFv2vdNdAckajnug0_Vw&s=19). However, you can still use `llms.txt` effectively through an MCP server.

### ðŸš€ Use the `mcpdoc` Server

We provide an **MCP server** that was designed to serve documentation for LLMs and IDEs:

ðŸ‘‰ **[langchain-ai/mcpdoc GitHub Repository](https://github.com/langchain-ai/mcpdoc)**

This MCP server allows integrating `llms.txt` into tools like **Cursor**, **Windsurf**, **Claude**, and **Claude Code**.

ðŸ“˜ **Setup instructions and usage examples** are available in the repository.

## Using `llms-full.txt`

The LangGraph `llms-full.txt` file typically contains several hundred thousand tokens, exceeding the context window limitations of most LLMs. To effectively use this file:

1. **With IDEs (e.g., Cursor, Windsurf)**:
    - Add the `llms-full.txt` as custom documentation. The IDE will automatically chunk and index the content, implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

2. **Without IDE support**:
    - Use a chat model with a large context window.
    - Implement a RAG strategy to manage and query the documentation efficiently.
