    "# Build a Customer Support Bot\n",
    "\n",
    "Customer support bots can free up teams' time by handling routine issues, but it can be hard to build a bot that reliably handles diverse tasks in a way that doesn't leave the user pulling their hair out.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will build a customer support bot for an airline to help users research and make travel arrangements. You'll learn to use LangGraph's interrupts and checkpointers and more complex state to organize your assistant's tools and manage a user's flight bookings, hotel reservations, car rentals, and excursions. It assumes you are familiar with the concepts presented in the [LangGraph introductory tutorial](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/introduction/).\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end, you'll have built a working bot and gained an understanding of  LangGraph's key concepts and architectures. You'll be able to apply these design patterns to your other AI projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your final chat bot will look something like the following diagram:\n",

    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "First, set up your environment. We'll install this tutorial's prerequisites, download the test DB, and define the tools we will reuse in each section.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be using Claude as our LLM and define a number of custom tools. While most of our tools will connect to a local sqlite database (and require no additional dependencies), we will also provide a general web search to the agent using Tavily."

    "## Part 1: Zero-shot Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "When building, it's best to start with the simplest working implementation and use an [evaluation tool like LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/evaluation) to measure its efficacy. All else equal, prefer simple, scalable solutions to complicated ones. In this case, the single-graph approach has limitations. The bot may take undesired actions without user confirmation, struggle with complex queries, and lack focus in its responses. We'll address these issues later. \n",

      "- Kunstmuseum Basel - This is one of the largest and best art museums in Switzerland with excellent collections of paintings, sculptures, and drawings.\n",
      "- Fondation Beyeler - Fantastic modern/contemporary art museum with works by Monet, Warhol, Bacon and more. A bit outside the city center.\n",
      "- Basel Paper Mill Museum - Unique museum tracing the history of paper and paper-making.\n",
      "- Spielzeug Welten Museum - Fun toy and doll museum for kids and adults alike.\n",
      "\n",
      "Day Trips: \n",
      "- Albertina Museum (Zurich) - Impressive collections of modern art and photography\n",
      "- Sammlung Rosengart (Lucerne) - Housing works by Picasso, Cézanne, Klee and more\n",
      "- Olympic Museum (Lausanne) \n",
      "\n",
      "Since I couldn't find any pre-booked options, I'd recommend just planning to visit whichever museums pique your interest most once you're in Basel, using your rental car to get around.

      "Sure, let's book an museum visit for your second day in Basel, which will be Wednesday, May 9th.\n",

      "Based on the excellent museum options you have in Basel itself, I'd recommend visiting the acclaimed Kunstmuseum Basel, one of the largest and most impressive art museums in Switzerland.\n",

      "\n",
      "- It houses the largest and most significant public art collection in the entire country\n",
      "- The collection spans from the 15th century up through contemporary art\n",
      "- Notable works by Holbein, Witz, Cranach, Böcklin, Cézanne, Gauguin, Monet, Picasso and more\n",
      "- The main building was designed by Christ & Gantenbein and has received architectural awards\n",
      "- They have excellent audio guide tours available in multiple languages\n",
      "- The museum is conveniently located in the city center, about a 10 minute walk from your hotel\n",
      "\n",
      "My recommendation would be to plan to arrive at the Kunstmuseum Basel around 10am on Wednesday, May 9th after breakfast. This will allow you to purchase tickets and take your time exploring their impeccable collections and audio tours.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. The assistant booked a car when we were focusing on lodging, then had to cancel and rebook later on: oops! The user should have final say before booking to avoid unwanted feeds.\n",
    "2. The assistant struggled to search for recommendations. We could improve this by adding more verbose instructions and examples using the tool, but doing this for every tool can lead to a large prompt and overwhelmed agent.\n",
    "3. The assistant had to do an explicit search just to get the user's relevant information. We can save a lot of time by fetching the user's relevant travel details immediately so the assistant can directly respond.\n",

Note [from this trace](https://smith.langchain.com/public/a077f4be-6baa-4e97-89f7-0dabc65c0fd0/r) that you typically **resume** a flow by invoking the graph with `(None, config)`.

    "## Part 4: Specialized Workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous sections, we saw how \"wide\" chat-bots, relying on a single prompt and LLM to handle various user intents, can get us far. However, it's difficult to create **predictably great** user experiences for known intents with this approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, your graph can detect userintent and select the appropriate workflow or \"skill\" to satisfy the user's needs. Each workflow can focus on its domain, allowing for isolated improvements without degrading the overall assistant.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we'll split user experiences into separate sub-graphs, resulting in a structure like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./img/part-4-diagram.png\" src=\"../img/part-4-diagram.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "In the diagram above, each square wraps an agentic, focused workflow. The primary assistant fields the user's initial queries, and the graph routes to the appropriate \"expert\" based on the query content.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### State\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to keep track of which sub-graph is in control at any given moment. While we _could_ do this through some arithmetic on the message list, it's easier to track as a dedicated **stack**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Add a `dialog_state` list to the `State` below. Any time a `node` is run and returns a value for `dialog_state`, the `update_dialog_stack` function will be called to determine how to apply the update."

    "We're about ready to create the graph. In the previous section, we made the design decision to have a shared `messages` state between all the nodes. This is powerful in that each delegated assistant can see the entire user journey and have a shared context. This, however, means that weaker LLMs can easily get mixed up about there specific scope. To mark the \"handoff\" between the primary assistant and one of the delegated workflows (and complete the tool call from the router), we will add a `ToolMessage` to the state.\n",
