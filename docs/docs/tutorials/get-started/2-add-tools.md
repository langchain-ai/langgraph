# Add tools

To handle queries that your chatbot can't answer "from memory", integrate a web search tool. The chatbot can use this tool to find relevant information and provide better responses.

!!! note

    This tutorial builds on [Build a basic chatbot](./1-build-basic-chatbot.md).

## Prerequisites

Before you start this tutorial, ensure you have the following:

- An API key for the [Tavily Search Engine](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/tavily_search/).

## 1. Install the search engine

Install the requirements to use the [Tavily Search Engine](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/tavily_search/):

```bash
pip install -U langchain-tavily
```
## 2. Configure your environment

Configure your environment with your search engine API key:

```bash
_set_env("TAVILY_API_KEY")
```

```
TAVILY_API_KEY:  ········
```

## 3. Define the tool

Define the web search tool:

```python
from langchain_tavily import TavilySearch

tool = TavilySearch(max_results=2)
tools = [tool]
tool.invoke("What's a 'node' in LangGraph?")
```

The results are page summaries our chat bot can use to answer questions:

```
{'query': "What's a 'node' in LangGraph?",
'follow_up_questions': None,
'answer': None,
'images': [],
'results': [{'title': "Introduction to LangGraph: A Beginner's Guide - Medium",

We define nodes for classifying the input, handling greetings, and handling search queries. def classify_input_node(state): LangGraph is a versatile tool for building complex, stateful applications with LLMs. By understanding its core concepts and working through simple examples, beginners can start to leverage its power for their projects.

'response_time': 1.38}
```

## 4. Define the graph

For the `StateGraph` you created in the [first tutorial](./1-build-basic-chatbot.md), add `bind_tools` on the LLM. This lets the LLM know the correct JSON format to use if it wants to use the search engine.

Let's first select our LLM:

{!snippets/chat_model_tabs.md!}

<!---
```python
from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model

llm = init_chat_model("anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-latest")
```
-->

We can now incorporate it into a `StateGraph`:

```python hl_lines="15"
from typing import Annotated

from typing_extensions import TypedDict

from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages

class State(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]

graph_builder = StateGraph(State)

# Modification: tell the LLM which tools it can call
# highlight-next-line
llm_with_tools = llm.bind_tools(tools)

def chatbot(state: State):
    return {"messages": [llm_with_tools.invoke(state["messages"])]}

graph_builder.add_node("chatbot", chatbot)
```

## 5. Create a function to run the tools

Now, create a function to run the tools if they are called. Do this by adding the tools to a new node called`BasicToolNode` that checks the most recent message in the state and calls tools if the message contains `tool_calls`. It relies on the LLM's `tool_calling` support, which is available in Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini, and a number of other LLM providers.

```python
import json

from langchain_core.messages import ToolMessage


class BasicToolNode:
    """A node that runs the tools requested in the last AIMessage."""

    def __init__(self, tools: list) -> None:
        self.tools_by_name = {tool.name: tool for tool in tools}

    def __call__(self, inputs: dict):
        if messages := inputs.get("messages", []):
            message = messages[-1]
        else:
            raise ValueError("No message found in input")
        outputs = []
        for tool_call in message.tool_calls:
            tool_result = self.tools_by_name[tool_call["name"]].invoke(
                tool_call["args"]
            )
            outputs.append(
                ToolMessage(
                    content=json.dumps(tool_result),
                    name=tool_call["name"],
                    tool_call_id=tool_call["id"],
                )
            )
        return {"messages": outputs}


tool_node = BasicToolNode(tools=[tool])
graph_builder.add_node("tools", tool_node)
```

!!! note

    If you do not want to build this yourself in the future, you can use LangGraph's prebuilt [ToolNode](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/agents/#langgraph.prebuilt.tool_node.ToolNode).

## 6. Define the `conditional_edges`

With the tool node added, now you can define the `conditional_edges`. 

**Edges** route the control flow from one node to the next. **Conditional edges** start from a single node and usually contain "if" statements to route to different nodes depending on the current graph state. These functions receive the current graph `state` and return a string or list of strings indicating which node(s) to call next.

Next, define a router function called `route_tools` that checks for `tool_calls` in the chatbot's output. Provide this function to the graph by calling `add_conditional_edges`, which tells the graph that whenever the `chatbot` node completes to check this function to see where to go next. 

The condition will route to `tools` if tool calls are present and `END` if not. Because the condition can return `END`, you do not need to explicitly set a `finish_point` this time.

```python
def route_tools(
    state: State,
):
    """
    Use in the conditional_edge to route to the ToolNode if the last message
    has tool calls. Otherwise, route to the end.
    """
    if isinstance(state, list):
        ai_message = state[-1]
    elif messages := state.get("messages", []):
        ai_message = messages[-1]
    else:
        raise ValueError(f"No messages found in input state to tool_edge: {state}")
    if hasattr(ai_message, "tool_calls") and len(ai_message.tool_calls) > 0:
        return "tools"
    return END


# The `tools_condition` function returns "tools" if the chatbot asks to use a tool, and "END" if
# it is fine directly responding. This conditional routing defines the main agent loop.
graph_builder.add_conditional_edges(
    "chatbot",
    route_tools,
    # The following dictionary lets you tell the graph to interpret the condition's outputs as a specific node
    # It defaults to the identity function, but if you
    # want to use a node named something else apart from "tools",
    # You can update the value of the dictionary to something else
    # e.g., "tools": "my_tools"
    {"tools": "tools", END: END},
)
# Any time a tool is called, we return to the chatbot to decide the next step
graph_builder.add_edge("tools", "chatbot")
graph_builder.add_edge(START, "chatbot")
graph = graph_builder.compile()
```

!!! note

    You can replace this with the prebuilt [tools_condition](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/prebuilt/#tools_condition) to be more concise. 

## 7. Visualize the graph (optional)

You can visualize the graph using the `get_graph` method and one of the "draw" methods, like `draw_ascii` or `draw_png`. The `draw` methods each require additional dependencies.

```python
from IPython.display import Image, display

try:
    display(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))
except Exception:
    # This requires some extra dependencies and is optional
    pass
```

## 8. Ask the bot questions

Now you can ask the chatbot questions outside its training data:

```python
def stream_graph_updates(user_input: str):
    for event in graph.stream({"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": user_input}]}):
        for value in event.values():
            print("Assistant:", value["messages"][-1].content)

while True:
    try:
        user_input = input("User: ")
        if user_input.lower() in ["quit", "exit", "q"]:
            print("Goodbye!")
            break

        stream_graph_updates(user_input)
    except:
        # fallback if input() is not available
        user_input = "What do you know about LangGraph?"
        print("User: " + user_input)
        stream_graph_updates(user_input)
        break
```

## 9. Use prebuilts

For ease of use, adjust your code to replace the following with LangGraph prebuilt components. These have built in functionality like parallel API execution.

- `BasicToolNode` is replaced with the prebuilt [ToolNode](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/prebuilt/#toolnode)
- `route_tools` is replaced with the prebuilt [tools_condition](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/prebuilt/#tools_condition)

**Congratulations!** You've created a conversational agent in LangGraph that can use a search engine to retrieve updated information when needed. Now it can handle a wider range of user queries. To inspect all the steps your agent just took, check out this [LangSmith trace](https://smith.langchain.com/public/4fbd7636-25af-4638-9587-5a02fdbb0172/r).

## Next steps

The chatbot cannot remember past interactions on its own, which limits its ability to have coherent, multi-turn conversations. In the next part, you will [add **memory**](./3-add-memory.md) to address this.
