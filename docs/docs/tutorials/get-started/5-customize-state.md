# Customize state

In this tutorial, you will add additional fields to the state to define complex behavior without relying on the message list. The chatbot will use its search tool to find specific information and forward them to a human for review.

!!! note

    This tutorial builds on [Add human-in-the-loop controls](./4-human-in-the-loop.md).

## 1. Add keys to the state

Update the chatbot to research the birthday of an entity by adding `name` and `birthday` keys to the state:

```python
from typing import Annotated

from typing_extensions import TypedDict

from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages


class State(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]
    # highlight-next-line
    name: str
    # highlight-next-line
    birthday: str
```

Adding this information to the state makes it easily accessible by other graph nodes (like a downstream node that stores or processes the information), as well as the graph's persistence layer.

## 2. Update the state inside the tool

Now, populate the state keys inside of the `human_assistance` tool. This allows a human to review the information before it is stored in the state. Use [`Command`](../../concepts/low_level.md#using-inside-tools) to issue a state update from inside the tool.

``` python
from langchain_core.messages import ToolMessage
from langchain_core.tools import InjectedToolCallId, tool

from langgraph.types import Command, interrupt

@tool
# Note that because we are generating a ToolMessage for a state update, we
# generally require the ID of the corresponding tool call. We can use
# LangChain's InjectedToolCallId to signal that this argument should not
# be revealed to the model in the tool's schema.
def human_assistance(
    name: str, birthday: str, tool_call_id: Annotated[str, InjectedToolCallId]
) -> str:
    """Request assistance from a human."""
    human_response = interrupt(
        {
            "question": "Is this correct?",
            "name": name,
            "birthday": birthday,
        },
    )
    # If the information is correct, update the state as-is.
    if human_response.get("correct", "").lower().startswith("y"):
        verified_name = name
        verified_birthday = birthday
        response = "Correct"
    # Otherwise, receive information from the human reviewer.
    else:
        verified_name = human_response.get("name", name)
        verified_birthday = human_response.get("birthday", birthday)
        response = f"Made a correction: {human_response}"

    # This time we explicitly update the state with a ToolMessage inside
    # the tool.
    state_update = {
        "name": verified_name,
        "birthday": verified_birthday,
        "messages": [ToolMessage(response, tool_call_id=tool_call_id)],
    }
    # We return a Command object in the tool to update our state.
    return Command(update=state_update)
```

The rest of the graph stays the same.

## 3. Prompt the chatbot

Prompt the chatbot to look up the "birthday" of the LangGraph library and direct the chatbot to reach out to the `human_assistance` tool once it has the required information. By setting `name` and `birthday` in the arguments for the tool, you force the chatbot to generate proposals for these fields.

```python
user_input = (
    "Can you look up when LangGraph was released? "
    "When you have the answer, use the human_assistance tool for review."
)
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}}

events = graph.stream(
    {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": user_input}]},
    config,
    stream_mode="values",
)
for event in events:
    if "messages" in event:
        event["messages"][-1].pretty_print()
```

```

We've hit the `interrupt` in the `human_assistance` tool again.

## 4. Add human assistance

The chatbot failed to identify the correct date, so supply it with information:

```python
human_command = Command(
    resume={
        "name": "LangGraph",
        "birthday": "Jan 17, 2024",
    },
)

events = graph.stream(human_command, config, stream_mode="values")
for event in events:
    if "messages" in event:
        event["messages"][-1].pretty_print()
```

```

================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: human_assistance

Made a correction: {'name': 'LangGraph', 'birthday': 'Jan 17, 2024'}
================================== Ai Message ==================================

Thank you for the human assistance. I can now provide you with the correct information about LangGraph's release date.

LangGraph was initially released on January 17, 2024. This information comes from the human assistance correction, which is more accurate than the search results I initially found.

To summarize:
1. LangGraph's original release date: January 17, 2024
2. LangGraph Cloud announcement: June 27, 2024

It's worth noting that LangGraph had been in development and use for some time before the LangGraph Cloud announcement, but the official initial release of LangGraph itself was on January 17, 2024.
```

Note that these fields are now reflected in the state:

```python
snapshot = graph.get_state(config)

{k: v for k, v in snapshot.values.items() if k in ("name", "birthday")}
```

```
{'name': 'LangGraph', 'birthday': 'Jan 17, 2024'}
```

This makes them easily accessible to downstream nodes (e.g., a node that further processes or stores the information).

## 5. Manually update the state

LangGraph gives a high degree of control over the application state. For instance, at any point (including when interrupted), you can manually override a key using `graph.update_state`:

``` python
graph.update_state(config, {"name": "LangGraph (library)"})
```

```
{'configurable': {'thread_id': '1',
  'checkpoint_ns': '',
  'checkpoint_id': '1efd4ec5-cf69-6352-8006-9278f1730162'}}
```

## 6. View the new value

If you call `graph.get_state`, you can see the new value is reflected:

``` python
snapshot = graph.get_state(config)

{k: v for k, v in snapshot.values.items() if k in ("name", "birthday")}
```

```
{'name': 'LangGraph (library)', 'birthday': 'Jan 17, 2024'}
```

Manual state updates will [generate a trace](https://smith.langchain.com/public/7ebb7827-378d-49fe-9f6c-5df0e90086c8/r) in LangSmith. If desired, they can also be used to [control human-in-the-loop workflows](../../how-tos/human_in_the_loop/edit-graph-state.md). Use of the `interrupt` function is generally recommended instead, as it allows data to be transmitted in a human-in-the-loop interaction independently of state updates.

**Congratulations!** You've added custom keys to the state to facilitate a more complex workflow, and learned how to generate state updates from inside tools.

## Next steps

There's one more concept to review before finishing the LangGraph basics tutorials: connecting `checkpointing` and `state updates` to [time travel](./6-time-travel.md).
