    "# Chat Bot Evaluation as Multi-agent Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "When building a chat bot, such as a customer support assistant, it can be hard to properly evalute your bot's performance. It's time-consuming to have to manually interact with it intensively for each code change.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to make the evaluation process easier and more reproducible is to simulate a user interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "With LangGraph, it's easy to set this up. Below is an example of how to create a \"virtual user\" to simulate a conversation.\n",

That way, the majority of the family gets to enjoy the sand and surf while Aunt Lily isn't too far from a mountain getaway. Depending on where you live, there might be some places not too far away that offer both. \\n\\nFor instance, places like the Central Coast of California have beaches and they're not too far from mountains. Or you could look into a spot like the South of France, if you're up for international travel and can find some deals. I've also heard that places like Costa Rica have both, but I've never been there myself.\\n\\nAs for the budget, I'm always on the lookout for off-season deals or vacation rentals that can accommodate the whole family.

Bali, Indonesia: This tropical island destination offers gorgeous beaches as well as volcanic mountains like Mount Batur. You can relax on the beach, explore temples, try water sports, and even trek through rice terraces and lush forests.\\n\\n3. Split, Croatia: Located on the stunning Dalmatian Coast, Split offers a mix of beach relaxation and nearby mountain hiking opportunities in places like the Biokovo nature park. Plus, you can explore the historic Old Town and nearby islands like Hvar.\\n\\n4. Cape Town, South Africa: With its iconic Table Mountain and beautiful Atlantic beaches like Camps Bay, Cape Town provides the best of both worlds. You can take a cable car up Table Mountain, visit the penguins at Boulders Beach, and even go on a wine tour in the nearby Cape Winelands.\\n\\nWhen it comes to budget-friendly options, consider booking vacation rentals, researching affordable or all-inclusive resorts, and keeping an eye out for discounts on flights and attractions. It's also advisable to be flexible with your travel dates, as traveling during the offseason can often result in more affordable prices.\\n\\nLet me know if you need any more information or help with planning specific activities or accommodations in any of these destinations!\"),\n",

Cape Town would be an adventure for sure, but South Africa is a big trip. It's probably out of our range for now.\\n\\nI really appreciate the suggestions about being flexible with travel dates and looking at vacation rentals. That's the kind of approach we usually take.

It's always good to keep it in mind for future trips though, as it offers a unique cultural experience along with beautiful beaches and mountains.\\n\\nCroatia is known for its stunning coastline and historic cities like Split and Dubrovnik, but it can sometimes be on the more expensive side. It's always worth checking for deals and considering different accommodation options to make it more affordable.\\n\\nAnd yes, South Africa and Cape Town are definitely big trips. If it's not feasible for the current vacation, you can always keep it on your bucket list for future adventures when the budget allows.\\n\\nAs for your question, I do love to travel and explore different places whenever I get the chance.
