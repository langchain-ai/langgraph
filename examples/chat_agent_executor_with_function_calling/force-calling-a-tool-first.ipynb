    "# Force Calling a Tool First\n",

    "In this example we will build a chat executor that always calls a certain tool first. In this example, we will create an agent with a search tool. However, at the start we will force the agent to call the search tool (and then let it do whatever it wants after). This is useful when you want to force agents to call particular tools, but still want flexibility of what happens after that.\n",
