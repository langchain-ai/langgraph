    "# Chat Bot Evaluation as Multi-agent Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "When building a chat bot, such as a customer support assistant, it can be hard to properly evalute your bot's performance. It's time-consuming to have to manually interact with it intensively for each code change.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to make the evaluation process easier and more reproducible is to simulate a user interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "With LangGraph, it's easy to set this up. Below is an example of how to create a \"virtual user\" to simulate a conversation.\n",
