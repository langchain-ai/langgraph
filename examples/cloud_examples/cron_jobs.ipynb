    "Sometimes you don't want to run your graph based on user interaction, but rather you would like to schedule your graph to run on a schedule - for example if you wish for your graph to compose and send out a weekly email of to-dos for your team. LangGraph Cloud allows you to do this without having to write your own script by using the `Crons` client. To schedule a graph job, you need to pass a [cron expression](https://crontab.cronhub.io/) to inform the client when you want to run the graph. `Cron` jobs are run in the background and do not interfere with normal invocations of the graph.\n",
