    "# Build a Customer Support Bot\n",
    "\n",
    "Customer support bots can free up teams' time by handlinng routine issues, but it can be hard to build a bot that reliably handles diverse tasks in a way that doesn't leave the user pulling their hair out.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will build a customer support bot for an airline to help users research and make travel arrangements. You'll learn to use LangGraph's interrupts and checkpointers and more complex state to organize your assistant's tools and manage a user's flight bookings, hotel reservations, car rentals, and excursions. It assumes you are familiar with the concepts presented in the [LangGraph introductory tutorial](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/introduction/).\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end, you'll have built a working bot and gained an understanding of  LangGraph's key concepts and architectures. You'll be able to apply these design patterns to your other AI projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your final chat bot will look something like the following diagram:\n",
    "\n",

    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "First, set up your environment. We'll install this tutorial's prerequisites, download the test DB, and define the tools we will re-use in each section.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be using Claude as our LLM and define a number of custom tools. While most of our tools will connect to a local sqlite database (and require no additional dependencies), we will also provide a general web search to the agent using Tavily."

    "## Part 1: Zero-shot Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "When building, it's best to start with the simplest working implementation and use an [evaluation tool like LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/evaluation) to measure its efficacy. All else equal, prefer simple, scalable solutions to complicated ones. In this case, the single-graph approach has limitations. The bot may take undesired actions without user confirmation, struggle with complex queries, and lack focus in its responses. We'll address these issues later. \n",

    "#### Part 1 Review\n",
    "\n",
    "Our simple assistant is not bad! It was able to respond reasonably well for all the questions, quickly respond in-context, and successfully execute all our tasks. You can (check out an example LangSmith trace)[https://smith.langchain.com/public/f9e77b80-80ec-4837-98a8-254415cb49a1/r/26146720-d3f9-44b6-9bb9-9158cde61f9d] to get a better sense of how the LLM is prompted throughout the interactions above.\n",
    "\n",
    "If this were a simple Q&A bot, we'd probably be happy with the results above. Since our customer support bot is taking actions on behalf of the user, some of its behavior above is a bit concerning:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The assistant booked a car when we were focusing on lodging, then had to cancel and rebook later on: oops! The user should have final say before booking to avoid unwanted feeds.\n",
    "2. The assistant struggled to search for recommendations. We could improve this by adding more verbose instructions and examples using the tool, but doing this for every tool can lead to a large prompt and overwhelmed agent.\n",
    "3. The assistant had to do an explicit search just to get the user's relevant information. We can save a lot of time by fetching the user's relevant travel details immediately so the assistant can directly respond.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next section, we will address the first two of these issues."

    "## Part 4: Specialized Workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous sections, we saw how \"wide\" chat-bots, relying on a single prompt and LLM to handle various user intents, can get us far. However, it's difficult to create **predictably great** user experiences for known intents with this approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, your graph can detect userintent and select the appropriate workflow or \"skill\" to satisfy the user's needs. Each workflow can focus on its domain, allowing for isolated improvements without degrading the overall assistant.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we'll split user experiences into separate sub-graphs, resulting in a structure like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Part 4 Diagram](./img/part-4-diagram.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the diagram above, each square wraps an agentic, focused workflow. The primary assistant fields the user's initial queries, and the graph routes to the appropriate \"expert\" based on the query content.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### State\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to keep track of which sub-graph is in control at any given moment. While we _could_ do this through some arithmetic on the message list, it's easier to track as a dedicated **stack**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Add a `dialog_state` list to the `State` below. Any time a `node` is run and returns a value for `dialog_state`, the `update_dialog_stack` function will be called to determine how to apply the update."

    "#### Create Assistant\n",
    "\n",
    "We're about ready to create the graph. In the previous section, we made the design decision to have a shared `messages` state between all the nodes. This is powerful in that each delegated assistant can see the entire user journey and have a shared context. This, however, means that weaker LLMs can easily get mixed up about there specific scope. To mark the \"handoff\" between the primary assistant and one of the delegated workflows (and complete the tool call from the router), we will add a `ToolMessage` to the state.\n",
