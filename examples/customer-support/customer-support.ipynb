    "1. General Q&A\n",
    "2. Booking flights\n",
    "3. Reserving hotel stays\n",
    "4. Renting cars\n",

    "That's a lot of tools! We will first create a naive implementation that can use tools to try to accomplish these tasks. In each section, we will add great control using user confirmations and finally encapsulating each specialized user story or \"skill\" into separate flows (or agents!) for greater control and reliability.\n",
