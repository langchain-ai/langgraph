    "This is a simple example to get familiar with how to use permchain. permchain is a pub-sub framework which makes it easy to coordinate multiple LLM actors (whether these be agents or single LLM calls). This notebook goes over a simple example of three actors:\n",

    "- a reviser, responsible for taking a draft and associated critiques and editing it\n",

    "We will first define these actors individually, and then we will show how to coordinate them such that for a given input the writer will write a draft, and then the editor and reviser will go back and forth until the editor thinks its good enough."
