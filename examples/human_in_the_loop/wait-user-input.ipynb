    "# How to wait for user input\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main human-in-the-loop interaction patterns is waiting for human input. A key use case involves asking the user clarifying questions. One way to accomplish this is simply go to the END node and exit the graph. Then, any user response comes back in as fresh invocation of the graph. This is basically just creating a chatbot architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "The issue with this is it is tough to resume back in a particular point in the graph. Often times the agent is halfway through some process, and just needs a bit of a user input. Although it is possible to design your graph in such a way where you have a `conditional_entry_point` to route user messages back to the right place, that is not super scalable (as it essentially involves having a routing function that can end up almost anywhere).\n",
    "\n",
    "A separate way to do this is to have a node explicitly for getting user input. This is easy to implement in a notebook setting - you just put an `input()` call in the node. But that isn't exactly production ready.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, LangGraph makes it possible to do similar things in a production way. The basic idea is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Set up a node that represents human input. This can have specific incoming/outgoing edges (as you desire). There shouldn't actually be any logic inside this node.\n",
    "- Add a breakpoint before the node. This will stop the graph before this node executes (which is good, because there's no real logic in it anyways)\n",
    "- Use `.update_state` to update the state of the graph. Pass in whatever human response you get. The key here is to use the `as_node` parameter to apply this update **as if you were that node**. This will have the effect of making it so that when you resume execution next it resumes as if that node just acted, and not from the beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** this requires passing in a checkpointer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a quick example."
