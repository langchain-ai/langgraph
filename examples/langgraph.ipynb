Average temperatures typically range from the low 50s to the mid-60s Fahrenheit throughout the year. Summers in San Francisco are often cooler than in other parts of California due to the cold California Current offshore and the presence of fog, particularly in June and July.

Winters are mild and moist, with the majority of the city's rainfall occurring between November and March. Rainfall averages around 23 inches annually.
