    "\n",
    "LLMCompiler is an agent architecture designed to **speed up** the execution of agentic tasks by eagerly-executed tasks within a DAG. It also saves costs on redundant token usage by reducing the number of calls to the LLM. Below is an overview of its computational graph:\n",

    "3. Joiner: Responds to the user or triggers a second plan\n",
    "\n",

    "This notebook walks through each component and shows how to wire them together using LangGraph. The end result will leave a trace [like the following](https://smith.langchain.com/public/218c2677-c719-4147-b0e9-7bc3b5bb2623/r).\n",

For instance, `math(\\'1 + 3, 2 + 4\\')` does not work. If you need to calculate multiple expressions, you need to call them separately like `math(\\'1 + 3\\')` and then `math(\\'2 + 4\\')`\\n - Minimize the number of `math` actions as much as possible. For instance, instead of calling 2. math(\"what is the 10% of $1\") and then call 3. math(\"$1 + $2\"), you MUST call 2. math(\"what is the 110% of $1\") instead, which will reduce the number of math actions.\\n - You can optionally provide a list of strings as `context` to help the agent solve the problem. If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\\n - `math` action will not see the output of the previous actions unless you provide it as `context`. You MUST provide the output of the previous actions as `context` if you need to do math on it.\\n - You MUST NEVER provide `search` type action\\'s outputs as a variable in the `problem` argument. This is because `search` returns a text blob that contains the information about the entity, not a number or value. Therefore, when you need to provide an output of `search` action, you MUST provide it as a `context` argument to `math` action. For example, 1. search(\"Barack Obama\") and then 2. math(\"age of $1\") is NEVER allowed. Use 2. math(\"age of Barack Obama\", context=[\"$1\"]) instead.\\n - When you ask a question about `context`, specify the units. For instance, \"what is xx in height?\" or \"what is xx in millions?\" instead of \"what is xx?\"' args_schema=<class 'pydantic.v1.main.mathSchema'> func=<function get_math_tool.<locals>.calculate_expression at 0x14e1049a0> {'problem': 'x^3', 'context': ['$1']}\n",
