They are known for their short, rounded ears, dense coat, and hamster-like size. Unlike rabbits and hares, pikas lack certain skeletal modifications such as a highly arched skull and strong hind limbs and pelvic girdle.\\n\\n#### Habitat and Distribution\\nPikas are typically found in high mountainous regions where they prefer cooler climates. American pikas, specifically, can be found throughout the mountains of western North America, from central British Columbia and Alberta in Canada to various states in the US, including Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, California, and New Mexico. Other species of pika inhabit Asia, with the range extending from the Ural Mountains to the east coast of Russia and Hokkaido Island of northern Japan.\\n\\n#### Behavior and Ecology\\nPikas do not hibernate and remain active throughout the winter. They travel in tunnels under rocks and snow, and they have a unique behavior known as \"haying,\" where they gather and store dried plants to eat during the winter months. They exhibit two methods of foraging: direct consumption of food and caching food in haypiles.\\n\\n#### Conservation and Climate Impact\\nPikas are sensitive to high temperatures and are considered early indicators of global warming. As temperatures rise, pikas have been observed moving to higher elevations in search of suitable habitat and cooler conditions. However, the American pika is already an alpine-dwelling creature, and there is a limit to how much higher it can go, which may threaten their survival. Recent studies have shown population declines, likely due to climate change, which include warmer summer and winter temperatures and changes in precipitation patterns.\\n\\n#### Current Status\\nThe International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) lists the American pika as a species of Least Concern but notes that declining populations are not likely to rebound due to lost habitats from extreme temperatures. In 2010, the US government considered but decided not to add the American pika under the US Endangered Species Act, although concerns for their conservation continue due to their sensitivity to environmental changes.\\n\\n#### Human Interaction\\nPikas generally live in areas far from human activity. However, on the Tibetan plateau, they are sometimes considered pests because they are thought to reduce forage for domestic livestock and damage grasslands.\\n\\nIn conclusion, pikas are remarkable for their adaptability to harsh alpine conditions and their unique behaviors such as haying. However, they are vulnerable to the effects of climate change and habitat loss, raising concerns for their long-term conservation and survival.\\n\\n#### Sources\\n- Treehugger: [Surprising Facts About American Pika](https://www.treehugger.com/surprising-facts-about-american-pika-4864528)\\n- Wikipedia: [American Pika](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_pika)\\n- Britannica: [Pika](https://www.britannica.com/animal/pika)\\n- Wikipedia: [Pika](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pika)\\n- National Wildlife Federation: [American Pika](https://www.nwf.org/Educational-Resources/Wildlife-Guide/Mammals/American-Pika)', name='Researcher')]}}\n",
