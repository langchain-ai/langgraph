They are characterized by their short limbs, rounded ears, and stout bodies. Unlike rodents, with which they are sometimes confused, pikas are more closely related to rabbits and hares, belonging to the order Lagomorpha.\\n\\n### Physical Description\\nPikas are typically 15 to 23 cm (5.9 to 9.1 inches) in body length. They have an even coat of fur, no external tail, and resemble their close relatives, the rabbits, but with short, rounded ears. Their thick fur and small ears are adaptations to their cold habitats.\\n\\n### Habitat and Distribution\\nPikas inhabit mountainous regions where they have adapted to life in rocky terrains. These creatures can be found at high altitudes, with the large-eared pika of the Himalayas living at elevations of more than 6,000 meters.\\n\\n### Diet and Behavior\\nPikas are herbivorous and primarily feed on plants. They are known for their diligent behavior of collecting and storing food in their tunnels for winter. During the warmer months, pikas spend their days gathering grass in montane meadows and creating hay piles. These animals are also remarkable for their distinctive vocalizations used for communication.\\n\\n### Reproduction and Lifespan\\nDetails on pika reproduction and lifespan were not provided in the immediate search results, but like many small mammals, pikas would typically have a breeding season and a relatively short lifespan in the wild.\\n\\n### Conservation\\nPikas are currently facing challenges due to environmental changes. As their habitats are affected by the expansion of agriculture and the increasing temperatures due to climate change, pikas may find themselves in competition for resources. They are notably heat intolerant, which makes them particularly vulnerable to global warming.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\nPikas are fascinating creatures with unique adaptations to their high-altitude environments. Their role in the ecosystem, distinctive behaviors, and close relation to the rabbit make them an interesting subject for further study, especially in the context of environmental conservation.\\n\\n**Sources:**\\n- [Animals.net - Pika](https://animals.net/pika/)\\n- [OneKindPlanet - American Pika](https://www.onekindplanet.org/animal/american-pika/)\\n- [Facts.net - 12 Facts About Pika](https://facts.net/nature/animals/12-facts-about-pika/)\\n- [Wikipedia - Pika](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pika)\\n- [HowStuffWorks - Pikas](https://animals.howstuffworks.com/mammals/pika.htm)', name='Researcher')]}}\n",
