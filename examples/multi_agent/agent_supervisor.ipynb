Despite their rodent-like appearance, pikas are not rodents but rather are part of the order Lagomorpha, which also includes rabbits and hares.\\n\\n## Behavior and Ecology\\nPikas are known for their unique behavior of not hibernating and remaining active throughout the winter. They navigate through tunnels under rocks and snow and rely on dried plants, which they have stored during warmer months in caches known as \"haypiles.\" This foraging strategy, termed \"haying,\" is crucial for their survival during the harsh winter months.\\n\\nPikas have a preference for cooler temperatures, typically foraging in temperatures below 25°C (77°F). They tend to avoid direct sunlight and stay in shaded regions when it gets warmer. A study has shown that for every 1°C (1.8°F) increase in ambient temperature, pikas can lose 3% of their foraging time, making them sensitive to climate change.\\n\\n## Distribution and Habitat\\nThe American pika (Ochotona princeps) and its relative, the collared pika (O. collaris), are found throughout the high mountainous regions of western North America. These species prefer cooler climates and have been observed to retreat to higher elevations as a response to increasing temperatures. Their current distribution is believed to be a result of a retreat from much larger ranges they occupied in the past, which included Western Europe and Eastern North America.\\n\\n## Conservation Status\\nThe International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) lists the American pika as a species of Least Concern but notes that populations are declining and unlikely to rebound due to habitat loss from extreme temperatures. The sensitivity of pikas to summer heat makes them an indicator species for the potential effects of climate change. Studies have shown that some populations are in decline, and there have been cases of local extirpation, particularly in the Great Basin.\\n\\n## Human Impact\\nHuman activity has impacted the ecosystems where pikas live, with recorded interactions dating back to the 1970s. Such interactions have been linked to pikas having reduced foraging time, limiting the amount of food they can stockpile for winter. Additionally, pikas have been considered pests in regions like the Tibetan plateau, where high densities of burrowing pikas are thought to reduce forage for domestic livestock and damage grasslands.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nPikas are fascinating creatures with distinct adaptations that allow them to thrive in alpine environments. However, their future is uncertain due to the looming threats of climate change and habitat alteration. Conservation efforts, research, and monitoring are vital to ensure the survival of these unique mammals in a changing world.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Sources:**\\n- [Wikipedia - Pika](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pika)\\n- [Treehugger - American Pika](https://www.treehugger.com/surprising-facts-about-american-pika-4864528)\\n- [National Park Service - Pikas at Rocky Mountain National Park](https://www.nps.gov/romo/learn/nature/pikas.htm)\\n- [Wikipedia - American Pika](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_pika)\\n- [Britannica - Pika](https://www.britannica.com/animal/pika)', name='Researcher')]}}\n",
