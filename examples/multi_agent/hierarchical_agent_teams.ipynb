    "## Hierarchical Agent Teams\n",
    "\n",
    "In our previous example ([Agent Supervisor](./agent_supervisor.ipynb)), we introduced the concept of a single supervisor node to route work between different worker nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what if the job for a single worker becomes too complex? What if the number of workers becomes too large?\n",
    "\n",
    "For some applications, the system may be more effective if work is distributed _hierarchically_.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can do this by composing different subgraphs and creating a top-level supervisor, along with mid-level supervisors.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, let's build a simple research assistant! The graph will look something like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "![diagram](./img/hierarchical-diagram.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is inspired by the paper [AutoGen: Enabling Next-Gen LLM Applications via Multi-Agent Conversation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08155), by Wu, et. al. In the rest of this notebook, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define the agents' tools to access the web and write files\n",
    "2. Define some utilities to help create the graph and agents\n",
    "3. Create and define each team (web research + doc writing)\n",
    "4. Compose everything together.\n",
