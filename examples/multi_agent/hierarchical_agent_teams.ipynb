    "## Hierarchical Agent Teams\n",
    "\n",
    "In our previous example ([Agent Supervisor](./agent_supervisor.ipynb)), we introduced the concept of a single supervisor node to route work between different worker nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what if the job for a single worker becomes too complex? What if the number of workers becomes too large?\n",
    "\n",
    "For some applications, the system may be more effective if work is distributed _hierarchically_.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can do this by composing different subgraphs and creating a top-level supervisor, along with mid-level supervisors.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, let's build a simple research assistant! The graph will look something like the following:\n",

    "This notebook is inspired by the paper [AutoGen: Enabling Next-Gen LLM Applications via Multi-Agent Conversation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08155), by Wu, et. al. In the rest of this notebook, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define the agents' tools to access the web and write files\n",
    "2. Define some utilities to help create the graph and agents\n",

There are 27 species of sturgeon found in rivers and seas throughout the world, with 9 species endemic to North America. These species are known for their longevity, late maturity, and distinctive physical characteristics, such as a heterocercal caudal fin. \\n\\n## North American Species\\nThe following are some of the sturgeon species found in North America:\\n\\n- **Atlantic Sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus)**\\n  - The largest of the three sturgeons found in New York State, capable of living 30 to 60 years, growing 6 to 14 feet in length, and weighing over 200 pounds.\\n- **Lake Sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens)**\\n  - It has fewer than a dozen large and stable populations in North America, with some expected to be evaluated for Endangered Species Act protection by 2024.\\n- **Pallid Sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus albus)**\\n- **White Sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus)**\\n- **Green Sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris)**\\n\\n## Conservation Status\\nMany sturgeon species are now critically endangered due to overfishing, habitat loss, and pollution. Conservation efforts are aimed at restoring sturgeon populations to rivers and tributaries where they once spawned.\\n\\n## Chart: Sturgeon Species in North America\\n\\n| Species           | Habitat                  | Size          | Conservation Status   |\\n|-------------------|--------------------------|---------------|----------------------|\\n| Atlantic Sturgeon | Eastern North America    | 6-14 ft, 200+ lbs | Endangered |\\n| Lake Sturgeon     | Great Lakes, Mississippi | Varies        | Under Review (2024)  |\\n| Pallid Sturgeon   | Missouri River basin     | Varies        | Critically Endangered|\\n| White Sturgeon    | Pacific Northwest        | Varies        | Not Listed           |\\n| Green Sturgeon    | West Coast               | Varies        | Threatened           |\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nNorth American sturgeons are an integral part of the aquatic biodiversity and play a crucial role in the ecosystem. However, they face significant threats from human activities. Efforts to conserve and protect sturgeon species are vital for their survival and the health of their habitats.\\n\\n## References\\n- [American Oceans](https://www.americanoceans.org/facts/types-of-sturgeon/)\\n- [Earthwave Society](https://www.earthwave.org/sturgeon)\\n- [New York Natural Heritage Program](https://guides.nynhp.org/atlantic-sturgeon/)\\n- [Center for Biological Diversity](https://biologicaldiversity.org/w/news/press-releases/lake-sturgeon-will-get-endangered-species-decision-in-2024-2021-09-15/)\\n- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon)\\n\\n*(Please note that the sizes mentioned are approximate and can vary.
