    "# Plan-and-Execute\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows how to create a \"plan-and-execute\" style agent. This is heavily inspired by the [Plan-and-Solve](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04091) paper as well as the [Baby-AGI](https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi) project.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea is to first come up with a multi-step plan, and then go through that plan one item at a time.\n",
    "After accomplishing a particular task, you can then revisit the plan and modify as appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The general computational graph looks like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![plan-and-execute diagram](./img/plan-and-execute.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This compares to a typical [ReAct](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629) style agent where you think one step at a time.\n",
    "The advantages of this \"plan-and-execute\" style agent are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Explicit long term planning (which even really strong LLMs can struggle with)\n",
    "2. Ability to use smaller/weaker models for the execution step, only using larger/better models for the planning step\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The following walkthrough demonstrates how to do so in LangGraph. The resulting agent will leave a trace like the following example: ([link](https://smith.langchain.com/public/d46e24d3-dda6-44d5-9550-b618fca4e0d4/r))."
