## üìù Sample Inputs

The system handles various complex travel scenarios with detailed requirements. Each sample demonstrates how comprehensive inputs trigger all six specialized agents and their tools:

### Business Trip
```
"I need to plan a comprehensive business trip to London, UK for 3 days from March 15-17, 2024, traveling from Seattle (SEA) with arrival by 9 AM London time on March 15th for an 11 AM board meeting and departure by 6 PM on March 17th to catch a connecting domestic flight. I prefer business class or premium economy flights with major airlines like British Airways, Virgin Atlantic, or Delta. For accommodations, I require a 4-star or 5-star hotel in the City of London financial district within walking distance of Bank or Monument stations, featuring business center facilities, high-speed WiFi, room service until midnight, concierge service, quiet rooms with workspace, express check-in/out, 24-hour fitness center, laundry services, and ideally a business lounge. My itinerary includes visiting the London Stock Exchange area on March 15th afternoon, client meetings in Canary Wharf on March 16th morning, business dinner near Covent Garden on March 16th evening, and a morning meeting in Mayfair on March 17th before departure, requiring reliable transportation via Underground and taxi services. I want to maximize limited free time with 1-2 quintessential London cultural sites like Westminster Abbey, Tower Bridge, or British Museum, plus recommendations for excellent traditional British cuisine including historic pubs for casual meals and upscale restaurants for business entertainment. Essential requirements include seamless mobile phone connectivity for maps and communication, currency exchange guidance, payment method preferences, tipping customs, weather forecasts for appropriate business attire packing, transportation guidance between financial district and Canary Wharf, time zone considerations, business etiquette notes, emergency contacts, trip extension options if meetings run late, corporate expense tracking advice, evening networking districts, and March travel considerations including potential weather delays. My total budget is approximately $3,000 USD covering flights, accommodation, local transportation, meals, and cultural activities."
```

### Family Vacation
```
"Please plan a comprehensive family vacation to Paris, France for our family of four - 2 adults (ages 38 and 42) and 2 children (ages 8 and 12) - for 10 days from July 20-29, 2024, flying from Los Angeles (LAX) with preference for direct flights or minimal layovers departing in the morning to maximize our first day, using major carriers with good family services, entertainment systems for kids, and option to select seats together. We need family-friendly accommodations that comfortably sleep four people - either connecting rooms, a suite, or vacation rental with at least 2 bedrooms - in the 6th or 7th arrondissement or near Latin Quarter with easy metro access to major attractions, reliable WiFi, air conditioning for July weather, and laundry facilities for our 10-day stay. Our family loves museums and cultural experiences with age-appropriate activities engaging both an 8-year-old and 12-year-old, prioritizing Eiffel Tower (sunset ascent), Louvre (family-friendly tour), Notre-Dame area, Versailles day trip, Paris parks like Luxembourg Gardens and Tuileries where kids can play and run around. Food is important - we want authentic French cuisine but need kid-friendly options since our 8-year-old is picky, so we need family-catering restaurants, information about French foods kids enjoy, Seine river cruise with dinner if family-appropriate, and visits to local bakeries and markets where kids can sample treats. We're interested in cultural activities like family-friendly cooking classes, visiting local markets with samples, and short day trips to Giverny for Monet's gardens or nearby ch√¢teaux good for kids, balancing educational experiences with fun activities that won't overwhelm young attention spans. Transportation concerns with children and luggage require advice on navigating Paris metro with kids, whether day passes or individual tickets work better for families, alternative transportation when metro stations lack elevators, and child-safe walking routes between attractions. Practical family considerations include finding pharmacies with children's medications, understanding French emergency services and pediatric care, locating playgrounds and family restrooms, child discounts for attractions and transportation, managing jet lag with children, and maintaining routines while traveling. Our budget is flexible at approximately $8,000 total covering flights, accommodation, local transportation, meals, attraction tickets, and activities, and we need current weather forecasts for packing with kids, metro navigation advice, tips for keeping kids engaged during cultural visits, French customs when traveling with children, emergency contacts, required documentation for traveling to France with minors, and age-appropriate souvenirs and educational materials for lasting French cultural memories."
```

### Romantic Getaway
```
"I'm planning a special romantic anniversary trip to Rome, Italy for my partner and me (both in our early 30s) to celebrate our 5th wedding anniversary from September 10-16, 2024, departing from Chicago (ORD) with preference for business class or premium economy if budget allows, evening departures so we can work half day before leaving, prioritizing flight comfort for this once-in-a-lifetime trip using airlines known for excellent service and comfortable seating. We want luxury accommodations - a 5-star boutique hotel or romantic bed & breakfast in the heart of Rome near Spanish Steps, Trastevere for romantic atmosphere, or close to Pantheon area, featuring historic character and charm with room views (city or charming courtyard), luxury amenities like marble bathroom, high-quality linens, room service for romantic in-room breakfasts, and ideally rooftop terrace or balcony for sunset aperitivos. Our romantic wishlist includes classic Rome experiences with elevated, intimate touches: private or small-group Vatican Museums and Sistine Chapel tour early morning before crowds, sunset visit to Trevi Fountain, romantic evening stroll through Trastevere cobblestone streets, and Colosseum special access tour at sunset or with underground access. For dining, we're serious food lovers wanting authentic, high-end Roman cuisine at romantic restaurants with exceptional cacio e pepe, carbonara, and Roman specialties, featuring intimate lighting, excellent wine lists, and preferably outdoor seating for warm September evenings, plus wine tasting experience in Frascati or nearby wine region, and cooking class together focusing on traditional Roman dishes. We're interested in romantic day trips to charming hill towns like Orvieto or Civita di Bagnoregio, or Villa d'Este in Tivoli for romantic gardens, preferring intimate art and history experiences over crowded tourist activities, including private tours of lesser-known churches with beautiful art and sunset photography sessions at romantic locations. Transportation preferences include comfortable private airport transfers and for day trips, private drivers or small group tours rather than large bus tours, with scenic walking routes between attractions for romantic atmosphere. Special romantic touches we're considering include professional photography session to capture our anniversary celebration, arranged flowers or champagne in room, couples spa treatments, reservations at restaurants known for marriage proposals for romantic atmosphere, and romantic shopping for matching jewelry or art pieces to commemorate our trip. Our budget is up to $6,000 for this special celebration, willing to splurge on unique experiences, exceptional dining, and luxury accommodations, and we need current weather forecasts for September in Rome, recommendations for romantic photography spots, tips for avoiding crowds at major attractions, suggestions for surprise romantic touches we could arrange for each other, Italian dining customs, tipping etiquette, romantic traditions unique to Rome, and learning romantic Italian phrases and cultural customs around romance in Italy."
```

### Group Adventure
```
"I'm organizing an epic group adventure trip to Tokyo, Japan for 6 close friends (ages 25-32, mix of 4 males and 2 females) for 2 weeks from October 5-18, 2024, departing from New York City (JFK) looking for best value flights while remaining comfortable for the long journey. We need accommodations for 6 people through creative solutions like multiple hotel rooms (preferably 3 double rooms close together), large vacation rental, or traditional ryokan experience for part of our stay, wanting to experience different Tokyo neighborhoods like Shibuya or Harajuku for modern energetic vibes, Asakusa for traditional culture, and maybe one night in a ryokan in nearby Hakone or Nikko for authentic Japanese experience. Our group is fascinated by Japanese culture wanting deep, authentic experiences including traditional tea ceremony, visiting ancient temples and shrines (Senso-ji, Meiji Shrine), experiencing traditional onsen, learning about samurai culture, visiting sumo training stable if possible, trying traditional crafts like pottery or calligraphy, and exploring traditional gardens like East Gardens of Imperial Palace, while simultaneously being excited about modern Japan including crazy energy of Shibuya crossing, gaming and anime culture in Akihabara, teamLab Borderless or similar digital art experience, Robot Restaurant or similar unique Tokyo entertainment, and exploring fashion and youth culture in Harajuku. Food is a HUGE priority as we're all serious foodies wanting full spectrum of Japanese cuisine including authentic sushi at Tsukiji Outer Market, traditional kaiseki dinner, best ramen shops (different styles in different neighborhoods), authentic yakitori, and if budget allows maybe splurge on Michelin-starred restaurant meal, plus taking cooking class together focusing on Japanese techniques, visiting sake brewery or comprehensive sake tasting, and exploring food markets and department store food courts. We're interested in adventure activities like hiking Mount Fuji if weather permits in October, visiting snow monkeys in Jigokudani if we can fit day trip, exploring Nikko for natural beauty and temples, or taking day trip to Kamakura for giant Buddha and hiking trails, plus experiencing Tokyo's unique nightlife including tiny bars in Golden Gai, multiple karaoke sessions, and nightlife districts like Roppongi or Shinjuku with recommendations for foreigner-welcoming bars where we can interact with locals. Each person has approximately $4,000 budget so our total group budget is around $24,000 covering flights, accommodations, local transportation including day trips, meals, activities, and shopping, wanting to experience efficient Japanese transportation including rides on different train types and maybe short shinkansen bullet train ride to nearby city. Please provide current weather forecasts for October in Tokyo, comprehensive navigation and transportation information for group of 6 including JR Pass recommendations, cultural etiquette and customs we should know, language basics for essential interactions, group activity recommendations perfect for 6 friends traveling together, information about shopping districts, Japanese gift ideas to bring home, and any seasonal activities or festivals happening during our October visit."
```

### Cultural Exploration
```
"My partner and I (both culture enthusiasts in our late 40s with graduate degrees in art history and literature) want to plan an intensive cultural exploration of New York City for 5 days from November 8-12, 2024, flying from Denver as serious cultural travelers who prefer depth over breadth, spending substantial time at fewer institutions rather than rushing through many attractions. We need accommodations in Manhattan within easy reach of the major cultural district - ideally Midtown near Museum Mile or Upper West Side near Lincoln Center - preferring boutique hotels with character, history, sophisticated decor, and quintessentially New York feel, ideally with good library or reading area for evening unwinding. Our primary focus is New York's world-class museums approached strategically with expert guidance: at Metropolitan Museum spending entire day with private or semi-private expert guide focusing on Egyptian collection, European paintings, and new modern wing; visiting Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) with emphasis on understanding modern art movements evolution with insider access or curator-led experience if possible; Guggenheim for current exhibitions and understanding Frank Lloyd Wright's architectural vision; Frick Collection for intimate setting and exceptional Old Masters; and if time permits, specialized museums like Morgan Library & Museum for literary manuscripts and medieval artifacts. Theater is essential with both Broadway production (preferably critically acclaimed rather than just popular) and off-Broadway show representing innovative contemporary theater based on November productions, willing to pay premium for excellent seats. We're serious food enthusiasts wanting New York's culinary culture at highest level including tasting menu at Michelin-starred restaurant, authentic ethnic cuisine in neighborhoods like Chinatown or Little Italy, and iconic New York food experiences like proper New York deli, classic steakhouse, or authentic New York pizza locals would recommend. For art galleries, we want to explore Chelsea's gallery district and SoHo ideally with guidance about current exhibitions and emerging artists to understand New York's contemporary art scene and cutting-edge work. Architecture is another passion requiring guided architectural walking tour covering different periods of New York's development from historic landmarks to modern skyscrapers, particularly Art Deco buildings, High Line's integration of urban planning and art, and understanding how architecture reflects cultural evolution. We're interested in literary New York including places associated with famous writers, historic literary venues, independent bookstores with character and knowledgeable staff, and perhaps literary walking tour beyond surface-level tourist information. Our budget is approximately $3,500 total for both of us covering flights, accommodation, meals, theater tickets, museum admissions, tours, and cultural activities, preferring spending more on fewer, higher-quality experiences rather than seeing everything, and we'd appreciate information about museum memberships or cultural passes providing value and special access, recommendations for cultural events or lectures during our visit, guidance on timing museum visits to avoid crowds while maximizing cultural immersion, and suggestions for sophisticated evening activities beyond theater like classical music performances at Lincoln Center, jazz clubs with authentic atmosphere, or cultural salons and intellectual gatherings accessible to visitors."
