    "# Can Language Models Solve Olympiad Programming?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will build a computing olympiad agent that leverages three complementary techniques to boost performance: **reflection**, **retrieval**, and **human-in-the-loop** collaboration. You will construct an agentic graph capable of answering programming questions of increasing difficulty.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reflection**: In part 1, you will create a zero-shot tool calling agent and prompt it to reflect on the test case results to correct its initial errors. \n",
    "2. **Retrieval**: In Part 2, you will implement an initial retrieval step as \"episodic memory\" for the agent that retrieves high-quality few-shot examples from our corpora of programming problems to help solve the **bronze** level question.\n",
    "3. **Human-in-the-loop**: In part 3, you will use `interrupt_before` on an additional \"human\" node to guide the agent to a better answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "While LLMs are not yet capable of autonomously solving all these problems, through better agent design, you can create a system that far surpasses the capabilities of a basic ReAct agent at answering these questions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your final agent graph will be structured like the diagram below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![diagram](./img/diagram.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The techniques in this tutorial are all adapted from the paper \"Can Language Models Solve Olympiad Programming?\" by Quan Shi, Michael Tang, Karthik Narasimhan, and Shunyu Yao. You can check out their paper at the following link:\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Congrats on making it to the end! In this tutorial, you implemented an agent in LangGraph capable of solving challenging programming problems. You did so by leveraging a few common techniques to improve performance, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reflection**: while we didn't implement an explicit reflection step, our prompt and tool invocation was designed to encourage critique of previous outputs. You added this in Part 1.\n",
    "2. **Retrieval**: the \"episodic memory\" of the agent retrieves high-quality few-shot examples from our corpora of programming problems to help solve the **bronze** level question. In Part 2, you implemented a retrieval memory as an initial step.\n",
    "3. **Human-in-the-loop**: LLM-powered agents are still too weak to answer all these questions autonomously, but at times, they can get most of the way there and land on the right answer with human feedback. In Part 3, you used `interrupt_before` on an additional placeholder \"human\" node and then included your feedback by using `update_state` on the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs are not capable of solving all these problems autonomously, but through better prompting and clever engineering, you can create a system that is able to more reliably arrive at the proper solution."
