git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ifu-comparative-analysis.git
cd ifu-comparative-analysis
```

### 2. Set Up Development Environment

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install in development mode with dev dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

```

### 3. Create a Branch

```bash
# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Or for bug fixes
git checkout -b fix/issue-description
```

## üß™ Development Workflow

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_graph.py

# Run specific test
pytest tests/test_graph.py::test_create_analysis_graph

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v -s
```

### Code Quality

```bash
# Format code with black
black src/ tests/ examples/

# Lint with ruff
ruff check src/ tests/ examples/

# Type check with mypy
mypy src/
```

### Pre-commit Checks

Before committing, ensure:

1. ‚úÖ All tests pass
2. ‚úÖ Code is formatted with black
3. ‚úÖ No linting errors from ruff
4. ‚úÖ Type checking passes with mypy
5. ‚úÖ New code has tests
6. ‚úÖ Documentation is updated

## üìù Code Style Guidelines

### Python Style

- **Line length**: 100 characters (configured in pyproject.toml)
- **Docstrings**: Google-style docstrings for all public functions
- **Type hints**: Use type hints for all function signatures
- **Naming**:
  - `snake_case` for functions and variables
  - `PascalCase` for classes
  - `UPPER_CASE` for constants

### Example

```python
"""
Module docstring explaining the purpose.
"""

from typing import Optional, List
from ..state import AnalysisState


def process_document(
    document_path: str,
    analysis_type: str = "full",
    max_pages: Optional[int] = None
) -> dict:
    """
    Process a document and return analysis results.

    Args:
        document_path: Path to the document file
        analysis_type: Type of analysis ("full" or "quick")
        max_pages: Optional maximum number of pages to process

    Returns:
        Dictionary containing analysis results

    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If document_path does not exist
        ValueError: If analysis_type is invalid
    """
    # Implementation
    pass
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Guidelines

### LangGraph Best Practices

When adding or modifying graph nodes:

1. **State Updates** - Return only modified fields, not full state
2. **Type Safety** - Use TypedDict for state schemas
3. **Reducers** - Use appropriate reducers (operator.add for lists)
4. **Error Handling** - Catch exceptions and add to errors list
5. **Logging** - Use print statements for user feedback

Example node:

```python
def my_node(state: AnalysisState) -> dict:
    """
    Process something and update state.

    Args:
        state: Current analysis state

    Returns:
        Partial state updates
    """
    errors = []

    try:
        # Do processing
        result = process_something(state["input"])

        return {
            "output": result,
            "status": "success",
            "current_step": "processing_complete"
        }

    except Exception as e:
        errors.append(f"Processing failed: {str(e)}")
        return {
            "status": "failed",
            "errors": errors
        }
```

### Tools Best Practices

When adding new tools:

1. **Decorator** - Use `@tool` decorator
2. **Docstrings** - Clear docstrings explaining purpose and parameters
3. **Type Hints** - Full type hints for inputs and outputs
4. **Error Handling** - Graceful error handling with try/except
5. **Claude Integration** - Use Claude Sonnet 4.5 for complex analysis

Example tool:

```python
from langchain_core.tools import tool
from anthropic import Anthropic

@tool
def analyze_section(section_text: str, analysis_type: str) -> dict:
    """
    Analyze a document section using Claude.

    Args:
        section_text: Text content of the section
        analysis_type: Type of analysis to perform

    Returns:
        Dictionary with analysis results
    """
    client = Anthropic()

    response = client.messages.create(
        model="claude-sonnet-4.5",
        max_tokens=4000,
        messages=[{
            "role": "user",
            "content": f"Analyze this section: {section_text}"
        }]
    )

    return {"analysis": response.content[0].text}
```
