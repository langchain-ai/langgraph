# Sample IFU PDFs

Place your IFU PDF files here for testing and examples.

## Expected Files

For the basic example to work, you need:

- `ifu_v1.0.pdf` - Old version of the IFU
- `ifu_v2.0.pdf` - New version of the IFU

## File Naming Convention

You can use any naming convention, but for the examples we use:

```
ifu_v{version}.pdf
```

Examples:
- `ifu_v1.0.pdf`
- `ifu_v1.1.pdf`
- `ifu_v2.0.pdf`

## Tips

1. **Medical Device IFUs** work best, but any PDF will work for testing
2. **Keep file sizes reasonable** (under 50MB recommended)
3. **Ensure PDFs are readable** (not password-protected or corrupted)
4. **Use comparable documents** (same product, different versions)

## Privacy Note

Do not commit actual IFU files to version control if they contain:
- Proprietary information
- Confidential medical data
- Trade secrets

This directory is gitignored by default.
