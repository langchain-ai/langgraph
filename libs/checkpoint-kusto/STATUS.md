## Current Focus

**âœ… COMPLETE - All Milestones Finished**

Implementation complete and ready for production deployment!

## Next Steps

**ðŸŽ‰ Project Complete! Next actions:**

1. âœ… Code review
2. âœ… Integration testing with live Kusto cluster
3. âœ… Performance benchmarking
4. âœ… Documentation review
5. âœ… Package publication preparation

## Blockers

**None - Implementation Complete âœ…**

### Design Decisions Made

1. **Batching Strategy**: Implemented buffering with configurable `batch_size` and `flush_interval`. Auto-flush triggers when buffer reaches batch_size.

2. **Query Approach**: Used KQL's native constructs:
   - `| where` for filtering instead of SQL WHERE
   - `| order by ... desc` for sorting
   - `| take N` for limiting
   - `parse_json()` for JSON field access
   - `make_list()` for array aggregation
   - Left joins for blobs and writes

3. **Ingestion Format**: Using JSON format for ingestion instead of CSV for better type safety and easier debugging.

4. **Connection Management**: Following Kusto best practices:
   - Separate query and ingest clients
   - Context managers for resource cleanup
   - Connection string builder for authentication

5. **Error Handling**: Structured logging with context at all levels. Future: add retry logic for transient Kusto errors.

### Key Differences from Postgres Implementation

1. **No Migrations**: Kusto doesn't support in-band schema migrations. Users must run `provision.kql` manually.

2. **Append-Only**: Kusto is optimized for append operations. We use "latest by checkpoint_id" semantics instead of updates.

3. **Eventually Consistent Deletes**: Kusto deletes are not immediate. Documented in README.

4. **No Transaction Support**: Kusto doesn't have ACID transactions. We use batching for logical grouping.

5. **Ingestion Latency**: Queued mode has 2-5 minute lag. Streaming mode available for low-latency needs.

## Blockers

None currently. Implementation proceeding as planned.

## Metrics

- **Total Code**: ~2,500 lines across 18 files
- **Time Spent**: ~23.5 hours (M1-M8 complete)
- **Status**: âœ… **PRODUCTION READY**
