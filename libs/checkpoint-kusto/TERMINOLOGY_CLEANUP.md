# Terminology Cleanup Summary

**Date**: 2024  
**Version**: Part of v2.0.0 refactoring

## Overview

Completed comprehensive cleanup to remove all SQL and PostgreSQL references from the checkpoint-kusto codebase, making it fully Kusto-native in terminology.

## Rationale

While the implementation was based on the PostgreSQL checkpointer pattern, the code used **KQL (Kusto Query Language)**, not SQL. Variable names containing "SQL" were misleading and could cause confusion. This cleanup ensures:

1. **Code Clarity**: Variable names match the query language used (KQL)
2. **No Confusion**: Eliminates false impression that this uses SQL
3. **Professional Polish**: Removes all legacy Postgres references
4. **Kusto-Native**: Code reflects Kusto-specific optimizations and patterns

## Changes Made

### Python Source Code

#### `base.py` - Query Template Constants

**Renamed Constants** (6 total):
- `SELECT_LATEST_CHECKPOINT_SQL` → `SELECT_LATEST_CHECKPOINT_KQL`
- `SELECT_CHECKPOINT_SQL` → `SELECT_CHECKPOINT_KQL`
- `INSERT_CHECKPOINT_SQL` → `INSERT_CHECKPOINT_KQL`
- `INSERT_CHECKPOINT_WRITES_SQL` → `INSERT_CHECKPOINT_WRITES_KQL`
- `DELETE_THREAD_SQL_CHECKPOINTS` → `DELETE_THREAD_KQL_CHECKPOINTS`
- `DELETE_THREAD_SQL_WRITES` → `DELETE_THREAD_KQL_WRITES`

**Updated Comments**:
- Removed: "This is more complex than Postgres JSONB @> operator"
- Added: "Unlike traditional relational databases, Kusto requires explicit property checks"

**Preserved Context**:
- Kept educational comment explaining "Kusto uses different syntax than traditional SQL" (line 38)
  - This is appropriate context for developers familiar with SQL

#### `aio.py` - All References Updated

Updated 20+ references to use new `*_KQL` constant names:
- `aget_tuple()` method - query selection logic
- `aput()` method - checkpoint insertion
- `aput_writes()` method - writes insertion
- `adelete_thread()` method - deletion operations

### Documentation Files

#### `PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION.md`
- Updated code examples to use `*_KQL` constants
- Changed: `SELECT_CHECKPOINT_SQL` → `SELECT_CHECKPOINT_KQL`
- Changed: `SELECT_LATEST_CHECKPOINT_SQL` → `SELECT_LATEST_CHECKPOINT_KQL`

#### `SCHEMA_REFACTORING.md`
- Updated removed constant names:
- Changed: `INSERT_CHECKPOINT_BLOBS_SQL` → `INSERT_CHECKPOINT_BLOBS_KQL`
- Changed: `DELETE_THREAD_SQL_BLOBS` → `DELETE_THREAD_KQL_BLOBS`

#### Historical Documentation Preserved

The following files intentionally **retain** SQL/Postgres references for historical context:
- `PLAN.md` - Original design document references Postgres as source
- `DELIVERY.md` - Implementation summary with Postgres comparison
- `COMPLETE.md` - Achievement summary noting Postgres compatibility
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Design decisions comparing SQL/KQL
- `README.md` - Introduction mentions "replicates Postgres checkpointer"

These references are **appropriate** because they:
1. Explain the design rationale (based on Postgres implementation)
2. Compare Kusto vs Postgres capabilities
3. Document why certain decisions differ from Postgres

## Verification

### Code Quality
✅ No SQL references in Python source code (except educational comment)  
✅ No SQL references in test files  
✅ No SQL references in configuration files  
✅ All query constants use KQL naming  
✅ All method implementations use KQL constants  

### Documentation Quality
✅ Code examples updated to KQL naming  
✅ Historical context preserved where appropriate  
✅ Postgres comparisons retained (valuable context)  
✅ Design rationale documents unchanged  

### Functional Impact
✅ No breaking changes - only naming updates  
✅ Query logic unchanged  
✅ Tests remain valid (no test changes needed)  

## Impact Assessment

**Affected Files**: 4 files modified
- `base.py` - 6 constant renames + 1 comment update
- `aio.py` - 20+ reference updates
- `PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION.md` - 2 code example updates
- `SCHEMA_REFACTORING.md` - 2 constant name updates

**Breaking Changes**: None
- Internal constant naming only
- Public API unchanged
- Behavior identical

**Code Clarity**: Significantly improved
- Variable names now match query language
- No misleading SQL terminology
- Kusto-native throughout

## Conclusion

The checkpoint-kusto implementation is now **100% Kusto-native** in terminology while preserving appropriate historical context about its Postgres-inspired design. All query constants use KQL naming, all code comments reflect Kusto patterns, and documentation maintains valuable design rationale without misleading terminology.

This cleanup completes the v2.0.0 refactoring that began with schema consolidation and materialized view optimization.
